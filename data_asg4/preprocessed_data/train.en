Tom has been deta@@ ined by the police .
your name is fa@@ mili@@ ar to me .
it is com@@ pu@@ ted at 10@@ ,000 yen .
today I have a lot of things to do .
I stu@@ died for a year in Boston .
it doesn &apos;t look good for Tom .
he doesn &apos;t go to school anymore .
I couldn &apos;t believe my ears !
should I open the windo@@ ws ?
during my last spring vacation I took a job in a restaurant to help pay the c@@ osts of my trip abroad .
and , they &apos;ve already t@@ or@@ n up the garden .
they make to@@ ys at this fa@@ c@@ t@@ ory .
she almost got away with it .
I already told you .
the la@@ dy wearing sun@@ glasses seemed very strange .
where &apos;s the beach ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to play the b@@ ass guitar .
she sp@@ read hon@@ ey th@@ i@@ ckly on her to@@ ast .
do you spend more time with your friends or with your family ?
no one who is a de@@ cent human being could pos@@ si@@ bly supp@@ ort this project .
first of all , power off your c@@ ell@@ ph@@ ones and rema@@ in silent .
he decided that if God didn &apos;t ex@@ ist then everything was per@@ mit@@ ted .
get ri@@ d of her .
swimming re@@ gu@@ lar@@ ly is good for your health .
the woman sleep@@ s in the bed@@ room .
open the door !
does Tom have a hun@@ ting li@@ cen@@ se ?
where was Tom working then ?
he is no longer a boy .
that &apos;s quite me@@ an@@ in@@ gl@@ ess .
Tom isn &apos;t a very nice guy .
you are not at all what I expected .
that wasn &apos;t such a bad idea .
will you be doing that again ?
Tom seems un@@ sure .
too good to be true .
I remember both of you .
he gave up going abroad to study because of his father &apos;s sud@@ den death .
he sh@@ ined his shoes .
how much is the mon@@ th@@ ly rate ?
we took advan@@ tage of the fine weather to play tennis .
we could sure do with some rain .
aren &apos;t you going to sing ?
then you just have to fi@@ ll out this card .
Tom told me what happened .
there was not a c@@ loud in the sky .
I can &apos;t raise our child by myself .
they &apos;re not afraid of hard work .
this time , you &apos;ve crossed the line !
you should try to make the most of your op@@ por@@ tun@@ i@@ ties .
did anyone see you come in ?
Tom can no longer live here .
Tom died of li@@ ver can@@ cer .
it app@@ ears to me you &apos;re mista@@ ken .
are you a tre@@ k@@ kie ?
the pro@@ je@@ ctor doesn &apos;t work .
I ju@@ d@@ ged you too quickly .
the Russi@@ ans are on our side .
dr@@ y w@@ ood bur@@ ns well .
Tom was off@@ ered a lea@@ ding r@@ ole in a hor@@ ror movie .
there &apos;s no one by that name here .
Mary kept che@@ cking her watch .
you must start soon .
it &apos;s sno@@ wing there .
in con@@ tra@@ st to yesterday , it isn &apos;t hot at all today .
it happened so fast .
I need to speak with you right away .
I hel@@ d my brea@@ th and waited .
I don &apos;t have time for non@@ sense .
what &apos;s your favorite thing to do in your free time ?
what time does the store open ?
I know that it is high@@ ly un@@ likely that we &apos;ll see any w@@ hal@@ es today .
this is a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are .
today pi@@ lot fa@@ ti@@ gue seems more likely .
the best way to catch a train on time is to make sure to miss the one that pre@@ ce@@ des it .
there &apos;s no need to be afraid .
the stor@@ m let up .
I &apos;ll get right on it .
the person who wants nothing , ho@@ pes for nothing , and f@@ ears nothing can never be an artist .
he has red hair and fre@@ ck@@ les .
you &apos;re with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom couldn &apos;t believe his good fortun@@ e .
Tom found Mary &apos;s diary .
we had breakfast .
Tom is a fast eater .
Tom is good , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;ve no pro@@ of to the contr@@ ary .
the wi@@ cked wi@@ tch p@@ us@@ hed her into the deep water .
Tom slept in his office .
Tom was going to lie , but he ended up sp@@ ill@@ ing the be@@ ans .
stay close .
it &apos;s like bed@@ la@@ m in here .
she has wa@@ ter@@ ed the plan@@ ts .
Tom fa@@ ked his death .
open the door !
see you next week !
it is car@@ eless of you to say such things .
I &apos;ll put some s@@ alt on the meat .
Mary told John the secret .
he says we should go that way .
Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice was thirsty .
there were some students in the class@@ room .
I &apos;d like to help you .
tell him where he should go .
you should never ask a woman how old she is .
no one expected her to win .
the squirrel is the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an sp@@ ir@@ it of our tri@@ be .
the Pan@@ the@@ on is now a ch@@ ur@@ ch .
I apologize for what &apos;s happened here .
the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um is one of Rom@@ e &apos;s top t@@ our@@ ist attra@@ c@@ tions .
let &apos;s check the map .
can you put up with the noise ?
he has a P@@ ic@@ as@@ so .
we &apos;ll go by bus un@@ less El@@ en@@ a wants to take a ta@@ xi .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
I &apos;m so tired that I can &apos;t walk any longer .
it &apos;s well worth it .
he d@@ ried his swea@@ ty fore@@ head .
Tom slept on the cou@@ ch .
you &apos;d better not go there again .
I &apos;m watching .
Tom has a daughter named Mary .
I would give it to them .
have you ever been stu@@ ck in an ele@@ vat@@ or ?
don &apos;t forget to change the cat li@@ tter .
I think that &apos;s a lot of ho@@ g@@ wash .
Tom is a car me@@ chan@@ ic .
Tom is good at chess , too .
I already said no .
it wasn &apos;t worth as much as they were char@@ ging for it .
didn &apos;t you miss anything ?
she really got on my ner@@ ves .
we ate a ha@@ sty m@@ ea@@ l and left immediately .
did Pa@@ ki@@ stan@@ i intelli@@ gen@@ ce really know nothing about the ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist &apos;s wh@@ ere@@ ab@@ ou@@ ts ?
he slammed his door shut .
are you saying this doesn &apos;t matter ?
let me put this differ@@ ently .
we celebra@@ ted our ten@@ th we@@ dding ann@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ ary yesterday .
who wants to kill you ?
just between us , he &apos;s not a deep thin@@ ker .
the fact cannot be den@@ i@@ ed .
put your to@@ ys away .
a lot of bic@@ y@@ c@@ les are il@@ le@@ g@@ ally par@@ ked in front of the station .
Tom is sha@@ ving .
her yo@@ un@@ gest child is five years old .
how could you do that ?
she has a ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic person@@ ality .
Tom seems in@@ sin@@ c@@ ere .
it &apos;s as if Tom and Mary were made for each other .
they don &apos;t want us to see what they &apos;re doing .
I feel like a drink .
I can no longer stand this noise .
I &apos;m hol@@ ding in my hands a book by Sus@@ ann@@ a Ta@@ mar@@ o .
if I were you , I would wait and see .
she &apos;s nu@@ ts .
in D@@ en@@ mark , there aren &apos;t any yellow post@@ bo@@ x@@ es .
Tom wants to say hello .
we &apos;re not des@@ per@@ ate yet .
have you got 5@@ ,000 yen you could l@@ end me ?
what are you going to do to me ?
should I close the door ?
Unfortunately , I never got the chance to meet her .
we fight all the time .
he &apos;s smar@@ t .
don &apos;t tell Tom anything .
the answer mi@@ ss@@ es the point .
he off@@ ered to help me .
if you would like to have fur@@ ther infor@@ mation , please con@@ ta@@ ct me .
watch us .
if I had known it , I would have told it to you .
a ca@@ b is waiting .
you will not speak to me like that .
Tom was sitting in the dark , smoking a cigaret@@ te .
he doesn &apos;t show any sign of life .
could you give us a minute ?
ro@@ ck , paper , sc@@ is@@ sor@@ s .
do you have a we@@ b@@ si@@ te ?
can we at least think about it for a minute ?
I think you &apos;re the most beautiful girl I &apos;ve ever seen .
even though the train was late , we made it in time .
he knows how to fly a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter .
you re@@ mind me of my son .
I read this book when I was in college .
Tom loved banan@@ as .
a pen@@ cil is sti@@ cking out of your po@@ cket .
if only I were such a beautiful and tal@@ en@@ ted person .
I think it must &apos;ve been Tom who sent Mary that no@@ te .
the h@@ eat was unbe@@ ar@@ able .
I have to get up quite early tomorrow .
it was in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ able .
I ask about apples , and you answer me about p@@ ears .
newsp@@ ap@@ ers lay s@@ ca@@ tter@@ ed all over the floor .
at that time , white bread and meat were consi@@ dered a lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y .
the family loves to watch mur@@ der my@@ ster@@ ies together .
we were crazy about each other .
I &apos;m eating dinner now .
do you appro@@ ve of J@@ ill &apos;s new ha@@ ir@@ st@@ y@@ le ?
please write down everything I say .
from now on , let &apos;s eat lunch in the kitchen .
would you like to try it again ?
can you di@@ rect me to the train station ?
Mary is see@@ king a job .
he threw the book in the fire .
Tom started doing squ@@ at th@@ ru@@ sts in the waiting room .
come to my house wh@@ en@@ ever you like .
he threw the letter into the fire .
I always give something to the beg@@ gar@@ s .
if you like , I &apos;ll tell you about what happened to Tom .
this sta@@ tue bel@@ on@@ gs to us .
please do not think of a pin@@ k el@@ eph@@ ant right now .
please don &apos;t make me help Tom .
are there big ri@@ ver@@ s in Germany ?
&apos;@@ Po@@ or boy ! &apos; said the old po@@ et again , taking him by the hand , and lea@@ ding him into his room . &apos; come to me , and we &apos;ll soon make the@@ e warm again , and I will give the@@ e some wine , and some ro@@ a@@ sted apples for thy supp@@ er , my pretty child ! &apos;
he can &apos;t be under thirty .
I don &apos;t want that one .
do you drink wine ?
do Tom and Mary have learning di@@ sa@@ bi@@ li@@ ties ?
she might not know that we are here .
she has a bott@@ le of milk every morning .
I don &apos;t need that kind of stre@@ ss in my life .
she must be mad at me .
Tom and Mary went po@@ th@@ ol@@ ing .
hon@@ ey doesn &apos;t spo@@ il .
the old man had his only son die three years ago .
we climbed a shar@@ p s@@ lo@@ pe .
are you able to gran@@ t us a spe@@ cial dis@@ count of 5 % for 50 s@@ ets of the produ@@ ct ?
experience brin@@ gs wi@@ s@@ dom .
is there space for one more person ?
you promised me you &apos;d look after Tom .
I broke my leg while s@@ ki@@ ing .
I can talk to him for hours .
these books are yours .
the fre@@ sh stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ries went like hot ca@@ kes .
perhaps I can help you .
the prin@@ c@@ ess was be@@ tro@@ th@@ ed to a prin@@ ce who lived a great way off .
the yo@@ u@@ th unemp@@ loy@@ ment rate is at an all @-@ time high .
the boy doesn &apos;t know how to be@@ have .
he used a we@@ ed eater to cut the grass near the f@@ ence .
let &apos;s discuss the matter right now .
Tom put some milk into his coffee .
our patient is re@@ ga@@ ining consci@@ ous@@ ness .
Tom &apos;s p@@ al@@ ms were swea@@ ty and his mouth was dr@@ y .
Tom started reading .
all the se@@ a@@ ts are boo@@ ked .
the picture was h@@ ung up@@ side down .
you &apos;re more beautiful than her .
Tom pi@@ cked up the book and started reading .
Ar@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ olog@@ y is fun !
we happened to meet at the station .
I &apos;ve done business with Tom before .
leave us .
I met him by chance at the airport yesterday .
Tom walked .
you can &apos;t live without o@@ x@@ y@@ gen .
Tom is a fast run@@ ner .
maybe I ought to exp@@ and the memory .
Tom &apos;s house is completely de@@ stro@@ yed .
we know you &apos;re in here .
Tom lived a simple life .
she &apos;s worrying for your sa@@ f@@ et@@ y .
we like children .
Tom lived there for many years .
Y@@ o , check this out .
Tom is just trying to s@@ care you .
may I ask you a person@@ al question ?
would you really do that for me ?
I am reading a book about animals .
I prefer a hotel by the airport .
Thomas does not eat fish .
nobody here seems to know where Tom and Mary are .
I find the sh@@ ri@@ mp sal@@ ad del@@ ici@@ ous .
she compla@@ ined of the room being too hot .
Mary &apos;s eyes sp@@ ar@@ kl@@ ed .
I &apos;ll have someone take you home .
Tom has bought a new car .
was the teacher young ?
I want to buy this material for a new dress . how much does it cost ?
don &apos;t s@@ cream .
what makes you think I like you ?
F@@ lo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ ks became ob@@ sol@@ e@@ te long ago , but I still have some , and I still use them .
I can &apos;t do it .
the ice is th@@ ick enough to walk on .
Tom found them .
he had to spend the night at his sister &apos;s .
I already told you that .
she went on speaking .
I am given a mon@@ th@@ ly al@@ lo@@ wan@@ ce of fifty thousand yen .
there &apos;s not enough space here for 4@@ 0 people .
Tom worked there .
Mike could not keep up with his class .
we can leave our ba@@ g@@ ga@@ ge in a lo@@ cker .
it &apos;s just a cat .
I like her younger sister very much .
you weren &apos;t married to the ta@@ tt@@ oo@@ ed guy they took away in hand@@ ca@@ ff@@ s ?
you may have it .
do you want to tell me what happened ?
I &apos;m in@@ c@@ lin@@ ed to agree with you .
you decide .
the news can &apos;t be true .
he will pro@@ vi@@ de you with what you need .
I &apos;ll be back in a while .
where in Au@@ stri@@ a did you grow up ?
Tom is a pota@@ to f@@ ar@@ mer .
my father often rea@@ ds the newspaper during me@@ als .
never speak un@@ less you are spoken to .
you &apos;re almost as old as I am .
all of my children want to go to Australia .
Tom was late .
she was my best friend .
how do I explain it ?
I did the best I could to answer their questions .
how can I change that ?
can I keep this ?
I could keep it a secret .
Tom is a good gu@@ itar@@ ist .
I took it .
I wasn &apos;t drea@@ ming .
Ty@@ ch@@ o Bra@@ he ben@@ e@@ f@@ ited grea@@ tly from King Fre@@ dri@@ k &apos;s gener@@ ous supp@@ ort .
do you want to drink some beer ?
this squirrel is aller@@ gic to nu@@ ts .

Mary told Tom she thought they should get back together .
have you told your parents ?
R@@ ach@@ el C@@ or@@ r@@ ie was an American who was killed in G@@ a@@ za .
we must have fa@@ it@@ h in the president .
I always enjoy listening to clas@@ si@@ cal music in my free time .
it was rather easy for them .
you &apos;d better change your eating ha@@ bit@@ s .
did you pass the exam ?
you tried to stop Tom from doing that , didn &apos;t you ?
is there a big market for this kind of thing these days ?
I love sp@@ ending time with her .
who do Tom and Mary re@@ mind you of ?
Tom no@@ d@@ ded back .
Mary is pretty , isn &apos;t she ?
did your uncle let you drive his car ?
I thought Tom and Mary would figure it out for themselves .
the fra@@ me has to be sand@@ ed and v@@ ar@@ n@@ ished .
could I have three stea@@ ks please : one r@@ are , one me@@ dium r@@ are and one well done , but not bur@@ nt ?

my kids don &apos;t usually lie to me .
Tom pi@@ cked up the t@@ ap@@ e meas@@ ure .
do you go to ch@@ ur@@ ch every S@@ un@@ day ?
Tom can &apos;t get enough of it .
the price turned out to be lo@@ wer than I thought .
it &apos;s not an impossible re@@ que@@ st .
this word is difficult .
Tom said it was no conc@@ ern of his .
let me know your new address .
he wants to be a doctor in the future .
the girl noticed someone go out of the door .
I &apos;m not de@@ f@@ ending him .
he is more famous than Tar@@ o .
have you lost your reason ?
don &apos;t make an ene@@ my of Tom .
Tom as@@ su@@ red Mary that he &apos;d help her paint the c@@ ei@@ ling of her kitchen .
there can be no doubt whatever about it .
do you sell sp@@ ort shoes ?
history re@@ pea@@ ts itself .
to put it clear@@ ly , I don &apos;t like him .
Tom has no inten@@ tion of doing what Mary told him he has to do .
Tom still remem@@ bers you .
America is a country on the move .
Tom thinks his country is the grea@@ test country in the world .
I &apos;d sugge@@ st the following change .
be sure to be here by 2 : 30 .
don &apos;t you want to know what happened ?
are you sure you want to do it ?
that &apos;s fair enough .
I &apos;m waiting for my mother .
the ch@@ ess@@ bo@@ ard is the world .
aren &apos;t you ready ?
any chance of the par@@ c@@ el getting there by Sat@@ ur@@ day ?
I wish I had more free time .
Tom is the same age as I am .
Kim is four years older than me .
Mary wouldn &apos;t go to Boston if she didn &apos;t have to .
this medicine will give you some re@@ lief .
that was a terri@@ ble thing you said to Tom .
the box was so heavy that I couldn &apos;t li@@ ft it .
don &apos;t sh@@ oo@@ t me . I &apos;m only the transla@@ tor .
ga@@ m@@ bl@@ ing is il@@ le@@ gal .
I saw Tom at the library .
I don &apos;t know how she got my phone number .
Tom is here with me .
Tom was ti@@ p@@ s@@ y .
something &apos;s da@@ w@@ ned on me .
I heard someone call my name in the crowd .
if you understand , please raise your hand .
I had to dec@@ line his offer .
Tom first met Mary in Boston .
Tom ear@@ ns twice as much as me .
he is ha@@ ted .
it doesn &apos;t make a blind bit of difference .
I will bear your words in mind .
live and learn .
he went there to learn English .
work quickly , eat slowly .
he died yesterday .
Tom must &apos;ve known this would happen .
she is ashamed of what she &apos;s done .
can you give me a b@@ rief descri@@ ption of the thief ?
you don &apos;t know how heavy is the lo@@ ad you don &apos;t bear .
we are bra@@ ying like d@@ on@@ ke@@ ys .
this time , you &apos;ve crossed the line !
Te@@ ch@@ ni@@ c@@ ally he is still a student .
Tom la@@ id his bag on the table .
first , let &apos;s talk about Tom .
did the cat get your ton@@ gue ?
each year , twenty @-@ se@@ ven million ac@@ r@@ es of the tro@@ pi@@ cal ra@@ in@@ fore@@ sts are de@@ stro@@ yed .
that &apos;s child &apos;s play .
we just need more time .
last night pro@@ vi@@ ded a good op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity to see a me@@ te@@ or shower .
the v@@ alle@@ y was twenty miles wi@@ de .
can I leave my bag here ?
there were per@@ se@@ cu@@ tions of Chri@@ sti@@ ans under the Rom@@ ans .
she &apos;s my older sister .
he supp@@ or@@ ted himself with a stick .
maybe Tom should stay here with Mary .
I will only buy the car if they repa@@ ir the bra@@ kes first .
if it were not for the sun , we would all die .
all you have to do is write a few sentences about what you did yesterday .
the small se@@ ed became a large tree .
does anybody else know about this ?
Tom asked Mary for John &apos;s telephone number .
you can be such a dra@@ ma que@@ en , Tom .
we know how Tom is .
shouldn &apos;t we be doing something to help Tom ?
the old man ser@@ ved the king for many years .
everything that Tom said is true .
take what you like .
Tom seemed to have reco@@ vered .
Tom is irre@@ si@@ sti@@ ble .
I went out in spite of the rain .
there are sentences whose transla@@ tion into certain languages is sen@@ sel@@ ess and , th@@ ere@@ fore , should be avo@@ i@@ ded .
she con@@ fes@@ sed her love to him .
I &apos;m so tired !
Tom whi@@ sper@@ ed something to Mary that I couldn &apos;t hear .
I imagine that Tom will even@@ tually run out of money and have to go back home .
she is dra@@ wing a picture .
how long do you think Tom will work for us before he qu@@ its and goes to another company ?
in Bri@@ tain the M@@ et@@ r@@ o is known as the Un@@ der@@ ground , not as the sub@@ way .
we &apos;ll use what we have .
he fell from one ex@@ tre@@ me to the other .
when did you come back from Germany ?
Tom said that he was angry .
you &apos;re probably as very tal@@ en@@ ted as I am !
I &apos;d like to buy a map .
he did nothing wrong .
you can &apos;t escape .
that was a fun conversation .
I couldn &apos;t have said it better myself .
it was used only from time to time .
the mana@@ ger de@@ als with many problems .
during summer brea@@ ks , I ate dinner at mid@@ night .
Tom was there for three hours .
please do that some@@ time today .
the traffic ban@@ ked up for several k@@ ilom@@ et@@ r@@ es because two lan@@ es were closed for ro@@ ad@@ works .
I don &apos;t remember inv@@ it@@ ing you here .
I was surprised Tom didn &apos;t come yesterday .
each of us needs to fully exp@@ lo@@ it his pot@@ enti@@ al .
just follow them .
it is very rude of you to expect me to eat food that I do not want to .
I bought a new hand@@ bag .
she re@@ sen@@ ted being called a co@@ ward .
but he is still alive ?
this telephone is out of order .
no doubt he will pass the examination .
I couldn &apos;t have said that better myself .
I &apos;m not sure Tom is willing to help us .
it &apos;s na@@ i@@ ve of you to believe that .
she re@@ je@@ cted him .
I usually get up at 7 : 00 .
show me the ph@@ otos , please .
s@@ we@@ et dreams !
do you know if Tom is here ?
I have to do that before Tom and Mary get here .
I think Tom and Mary are still hom@@ es@@ ick .
could you let me see your no@@ tes ?
K@@ en@@ do is a Japanese mar@@ ti@@ al ar@@ ts which us@@ es ba@@ m@@ bo@@ o s@@ words and prote@@ ctive ar@@ m@@ our .
what day are you usually free ?
you cannot key in n@@ um@@ bers because the N@@ um@@ Lo@@ ck L@@ E@@ D is off .
things are advan@@ cing at a sna@@ il &apos;s pa@@ ce .
I already told you .
you know her .
is this ty@@ pe@@ writer yours ?
I &apos;ve been gone three and a half years .
you are tal@@ le@@ st .
he let her kiss him .
you can do whatever you want to , of course .
tears were r@@ oll@@ ing down her che@@ ek .
some animals eat their young .
there are three pri@@ mar@@ y col@@ ours .
we shouldn &apos;t have done this .
she isn &apos;t alone anymore .
Tom speaks excellent Russi@@ an , but his German is ab@@ y@@ s@@ mal .
&quot; why is your room pin@@ k , Tom ? &quot; &quot; Oh , this was my sister &apos;s room before . &quot;
he is not really a friend , just an ac@@ qua@@ in@@ tan@@ ce .
do you anno@@ y your brothers ?
I said nothing about the matter .
I saw a man kno@@ cked down by a car .
there &apos;s not enough coffee .
he &apos;s in a good mood today .
let me know when you need me again .
he &apos;s a Bri@@ ti@@ sh ci@@ ti@@ zen , but he lives in Indi@@ a .
you didn &apos;t tell us what he had written in this letter .
Tom passed away three days ago .
Mary put some flowers in the v@@ ase .
el@@ ep@@ han@@ ts are an en@@ danger@@ ed spe@@ ci@@ es .
Tom says he has no idea who Mary is .
both of my parents are dead .
you seem to know me , but I don &apos;t know you .
I don &apos;t remember saying anything like that .
see , you shouldn &apos;t work so hard .
I helped Tom yesterday morning .
find your@@ selves a seat .
the price is kind of high for a used car .
we &apos;ve been living here since J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
Tom &apos;s a p@@ et@@ ro@@ l head and loves anything to do with cars .
it seems that certain oper@@ a@@ tions cannot take place .
does Tom know what you do ?
it &apos;s one for@@ ty @-@ five .
Jim likes the doctor .
were you really in Australia ?
at first they re@@ je@@ cted the pro@@ pos@@ al , but a c@@ ler@@ gy@@ man ur@@ ged them to accept .
it makes no difference whether you go or not .
red al@@ ert !
why didn &apos;t Tom tell us ?
there are still many things left to do .
Tom is a singer @-@ son@@ g@@ writer .
I &apos;m a police officer .
something is telling me to ba@@ ke a cake .
are you the au@@ th@@ or of this book ?
I &apos;ll get these .
we just want you to be happy .
I think Tom has made a mistake .
you &apos;d better watch what you say .
the mother lay be@@ side her baby on the bed .
the f@@ en@@ der was ba@@ dly den@@ ted .
I don &apos;t want to do what I &apos;m planning to do , but I have no choice .
I had my shoes poli@@ shed .
you &apos;re thirty minutes early .
Tom was quiet .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re glad .
she was my first c@@ r@@ ush .
I &apos;m here as a friend .
many young people are out of work in the country .
our garden is full of col@@ or@@ ful flowers .
he &apos;s Tom &apos;s ch@@ au@@ ffe@@ ur .
Tom will be staying with us for the next three wee@@ ks .
he was born in the Mar@@ ch of B@@ ran@@ den@@ bur@@ g .
I don &apos;t know how you do that .
he is jealous of her talent .
the fur@@ nit@@ ure in this office is fa@@ ir@@ ly mo@@ dern .
by the way , one ten@@ th of one percent is one hundred percent of one per thousand .
Tom and Mary have suff@@ ered a lot .
the garden was filled with flowers .
Mary went to the t@@ ann@@ ing sal@@ on .
I didn &apos;t see what was in the box .
I don &apos;t know who &apos;s in char@@ ge of the business .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d believe me .
Tom never dri@@ ves above the spe@@ ed li@@ mit .
my brother is now in Australia .
where &apos;s the d@@ ining room ?
I don &apos;t think Tom is a los@@ er .
how much do you spend on food every month ?
you need not have hur@@ ried .
she crossed her ar@@ ms .

the price was in the neigh@@ b@@ our@@ hood of 50 dollars .
maybe that &apos;s the reason .
how long was Tom there ?
you &apos;ve been through a lot .
you &apos;re a French teacher , aren &apos;t you ?
I thought everyone was busy .
I don &apos;t like getting up so early in the morning .
are you feeling up to it ?
what does this sign mean ?
you should cho@@ ose your friends very carefully .
don &apos;t you ever speak to me like that again .

I &apos;ve called and called , but there &apos;s no answer .
will you go to the meeting in my place ?

she in@@ sul@@ ted him .
there were lots of b@@ und@@ les , but they weren &apos;t thousand @-@ d@@ ol@@ lar b@@ ills .

I am blin@@ king my eyes .
will that be for here or to go ?

have you ever been to Nar@@ a ?
is that your fin@@ al decision ?
I thought there was nobody in the kitchen .
the pro@@ por@@ tion of the world &apos;s popu@@ la@@ tion speaking English as a first language is dec@@ lin@@ ing , and will continu@@ e to do so .

you ought to be ashamed .
Tom showed me around the ca@@ mp@@ us .

I prefer the bla@@ ck one .
are you going out in those clothes ? how un@@ cool !
learn from Com@@ ra@@ de Le@@ i Fen@@ g .

Tom &apos;s bed@@ room door is shut .
I love you guys .
don &apos;t get me conf@@ used .

who planned that trip ?
that dress sho@@ ws off her figure to advan@@ tage .
in the morning I always wake up around se@@ ven o &apos;clock .
I &apos;m sorry , I fu@@ cked up .
where is the telephone book ?
U@@ l@@ y@@ ss@@ es asked his men to tie him to the ma@@ st .
you &apos;re the best squirrel in the whole world !
that &apos;s for you to decide .
I can &apos;t get in touch with Tom .
Tom wanted to kiss Mary then and there .
sit down and shut up .
your job is to make sure Tom does his job right .
write the a@@ moun@@ t on the check in letters as well as fig@@ ures .
in Australia , one speaks English .
she told him that she belie@@ ved in a@@ str@@ olog@@ y .

Tom felt in@@ sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant when he looked up at the night sky .
Kor@@ ol@@ e@@ v was responsible for the Sp@@ u@@ t@@ ni@@ k progra@@ m , which in 19@@ 5@@ 7 la@@ un@@ ched the first arti@@ fi@@ cial sa@@ telli@@ te into or@@ bit .

the dictionary on the desk is mine .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
this dog bar@@ ks a lot .
I had planned to stop at the super@@ market on the way home , but it was closed .
do you have a t@@ win sister ?
I &apos;m French .
I wouldn &apos;t miss it for anything .
you should &apos;ve told me the truth .
I can &apos;t stand hosp@@ it@@ als .
O@@ sa@@ k@@ ans sometimes r@@ ol@@ l their R@@ s like in Spanish .
Tom &apos;s en@@ ga@@ ged .
was Tom afraid ?
my m@@ om married my da@@ d in the 9@@ 0@@ s .
don &apos;t y@@ ell .
could I have a cigaret@@ te ?

doesn &apos;t that pro@@ ve something ?
do you want to sit in the front ?
if I were you , I would paint it blue .
he rema@@ ined silent .
I go to school by bicycle .
he ear@@ ns no less than three hundred dollars a day .
how do you know ?
I didn &apos;t trust him at first .
what was she doing in her room ?
I &apos;m tired and I want to go home .
Tom didn &apos;t deserve the pun@@ ish@@ ment he received .

Tom is a re@@ tired poli@@ c@@ em@@ an .
I wonder what happened to an@@ ci@@ ent Rom@@ e .
they are both very exc@@ ited .
my father used to travel .
I &apos;ll be in my office if you need me .

no work is as hard as the one you don &apos;t like to do .
he re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted our company at the con@@ fer@@ ence .
did you keep in touch ?
have you already made friends with her ?
why did you leave the light on in the meeting room ?
Tom wanted to ask Mary about how John died .
Tom knows what &apos;s good .
if an English spea@@ ker says someone is j@@ ol@@ ly , that means they are che@@ er@@ ful or friendly . but in French , j@@ ol@@ ie means someone is good @-@ looking or pleas@@ ant to look at . in any case , both are nice things to say to someone .
M@@ oh@@ and is my half brother .
are you done up@@ stairs ?
she asked me if I was all right .
high@@ er ta@@ x@@ es hurt the econom@@ y .
look at me when you &apos;re talking to me .
I &apos;ll never forget how hel@@ p@@ ful you &apos;ve been .
Tom looked again .
God doesn &apos;t make mistakes .
don &apos;t put the glass near the e@@ dge of the table .

do you know if Tom has already eaten ?
they &apos;re afraid of us .
Mary &apos;s eyes were filled with tears .
I called Tom up .
your death was not in va@@ in .
I had my wallet stolen on the bus .
Tom has some food aller@@ gi@@ es , so he has to be careful about what he eats .
this man is alive .
Mary said she thought Tom wasn &apos;t finished doing that yet .
Tom seems to like teaching French .
C@@ ul@@ tures of the E@@ ast and the We@@ st are mi@@ xed in this country .

I did so with a view to pleas@@ ing him .
I &apos;m just getting started .
you should &apos;ve introdu@@ ced yourself .
please fa@@ sten your seat b@@ elt during ta@@ ke@@ off and lan@@ ding .
this ex@@ plan@@ ation doesn &apos;t mean anything !
I &apos;m not here for a vacation .
the story gave me go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps .
we did everything for the wel@@ f@@ are of our children .
it didn &apos;t last more than three minutes .
Tom is one of Mary &apos;s brothers .
Tom is going to thank me .
no other c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ties have been repor@@ ted .

everybody seems to like her .
what are you writing ?
we spoke about an arti@@ cle that I had publi@@ shed .
he has got as many as fifty no@@ vel@@ s written in English .
Tom turned red .
don &apos;t set foot in that neighbor@@ hood .
I had something else in mind .
Tom and Mary bought a hand@@ made ru@@ g .
who talked ?
how do you like my new suit ?
he speaks only English and German , neither of which I understand .
would you be so kind as to l@@ end me your book ?
it was so nice to meet you .
a t@@ oo@@ th can be re@@ pla@@ ced with an im@@ plant .
she lives in an apartment alone .
this can &apos;t be a real dia@@ mon@@ d .

I would never l@@ end Tom any money .

Tom built a bir@@ d@@ house .
you should eat this while it &apos;s still warm .
the door was locked on the inside .

have you ever heard of something si@@ mi@@ lar ?
Tom isn &apos;t anything like his brother .
I don &apos;t think I snor@@ e .
it &apos;s six o &apos;clock already .
I wrote my th@@ es@@ is about that .
I &apos;ll do my best to get it for you , but I don &apos;t promise anything .
the beginning of the trouble was his car@@ eless re@@ mark .
some@@ body &apos;s kno@@ cking at your door .
I love to see you smile .
I wouldn &apos;t re@@ comm@@ end it .
Tom looked at me like I was crazy .
you &apos;d better get up early .
take a bus .

he consi@@ ders himself a gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an of mor@@ al stand@@ ar@@ ds .
why do you feel that way ?
Ko@@ be is the city which I was born in .
Tom never woke up .
Tom said that Mary was willing to help us do that .
I ste@@ pped on a piece of broken glass .
Tom said that he wanted to move to Boston .
for once in your life , you &apos;re exactly right .
she likes these cats .
if I &apos;m sel@@ ling to you , I speak your language . if I &apos;m bu@@ ying , then you have to speak German .
I just lost at the ra@@ ces so I &apos;m fl@@ at broke .
there is no li@@ mit to human pro@@ gre@@ ss .

it &apos;s been a long time since we &apos;ve had such nice weather .
what goes on in this room ?
n@@ one of the meat was fit to eat .
Tom and Mary said John wasn &apos;t at home when they went to visit him .
if these mus@@ c@@ les are weak , they cannot h@@ old the k@@ nee@@ ca@@ p in the correct posi@@ tion .
when Tom is at home , he doesn &apos;t want to talk about work .
I thought you might &apos;ve left town .

Tom likes S@@ wi@@ ss che@@ ese .
a di@@ ag@@ on@@ al ma@@ tri@@ x is posi@@ tive se@@ mi@@ de@@ fin@@ ite if and only if all of its el@@ em@@ ents are non@@ ne@@ ga@@ tive .
how bad was Tom hurt ?
A@@ pp@@ li@@ can@@ ts must be under thirty years old .
I hope he will come .
not having received a rep@@ ly , he wrote to her again .
how did you meet your husband ?
even given what you say , I still think you are to bla@@ me .
Tom was here just a moment ago .
he was in a mood of de@@ pression .
how &apos;s your mother , Tom ?
have you already brought the car@@ t@@ ons up to the at@@ tic ?
he asked me to do it .
do you like eating fish ?
he pi@@ cked up the phone .

we need fl@@ our , su@@ gar and eggs to make this cake .
you cannot be too careful driving a car .
the meeting ended ear@@ li@@ er than usual .
I have to teach Mary English .

I didn &apos;t like beer at that time .
please don &apos;t smoke .
Tom comes here every day .
my na@@ il has broken .
he &apos;s really sel@@ fish .
I &apos;ve been in Boston since October .
instead of waiting for Tom to come up and speak to you , you should just go up to him .
what is it now , Tom ?
has anybody spoken to Tom ?
they built up twenty @-@ five stories on one side and thirty @-@ five stories on the other .
&quot; where &apos;s Tom ? &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t make it . &quot;
A@@ part from a few min@@ or mistakes , your com@@ posi@@ tion was excellent .
they are brothers .

you weren &apos;t wrong .
my sol@@ e idea was to get there as fast as possible .
the truth comes to light .
is this real ?
Li@@ ons are stron@@ ger than w@@ ol@@ ves .
I wish my dream would come true .
I can &apos;t ignor@@ e that .
he won the first pri@@ ze at the chess t@@ our@@ na@@ ment .

I &apos;ll get my ke@@ ys .
he has more books than I do .
this figure is supposed to re@@ present Mar@@ il@@ y@@ n Mon@@ ro@@ e , but I don &apos;t think it does her ju@@ sti@@ ce .
it &apos;s very important to respect the ru@@ les .
raise your hand if you want to speak .
he &apos;s getting up early .
we &apos;ve made a fin@@ al decision .
I just started reading this book .
she looked me in the eye .
please don &apos;t ask .
do you know whose car this is ?
I have never been so hu@@ mili@@ ated in my enti@@ re life .
my father has lived in Na@@ go@@ y@@ a for more than fif@@ teen years .
I don &apos;t really agree with that .
Mary &apos;s father was a sa@@ il@@ or who never came back .
it takes two years for the bu@@ tter@@ fly to ma@@ ture .
don &apos;t rely too much on others .
it works on my mach@@ ine .
you need to wear th@@ ick socks to keep your feet warm .
I know something really fun we can do tomorrow .
is this your money ?
Tom noticed that Mary was asleep .
does he understand what he &apos;s saying ?
the car is running fast .

Tom jo@@ ined the disc@@ ussion .
he has no friends to talk with .
what keep@@ s you up at night ?
does your wife know ?
I hope this da@@ ta will be use@@ ful to you .
would you rather be blind or be dea@@ f ?
I cannot pass the matter by without making a pro@@ test .
I believe that everything happens for a reason .
I didn &apos;t kill anybody .
your examination re@@ sul@@ ts are excellent .

I think it &apos;s time for me to buy a de@@ cent camera .
park Stre@@ et needs to be repa@@ ved .
I &apos;m sorry , but I didn &apos;t know it was a secret .
only then did I realize it .

Y@@ am@@ as@@ hi@@ ta is stu@@ ck with no way out . his well @-@ thought @-@ out project was re@@ je@@ cted and the books he worked really hard on aren &apos;t sel@@ ling .
do you want to see Tom again ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t interested in Mary , but he seemed to always be looking to@@ war@@ ds the side of the room where she was .
I think Tom is jealous .
I can &apos;t believe that a guy like Tom was married to a woman as beautiful as Mary .
Tom remem@@ ber@@ ed everything .
he &apos;s not pa@@ ying any atten@@ tion to me .
are you here today for any parti@@ cu@@ lar reason ?
it &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous that you &apos;re wrong .
don &apos;t call Tom that .
Tom has his heart in the right place .
how many c@@ up@@ s of coffee do you drink a day ?

Tom just can &apos;t get along with Mary .
&quot; you don &apos;t mind , do you ? &quot; &quot; of course I don &apos;t . &quot;
I &apos;d like to know what you intend to do now .
many Americans did not have jo@@ bs .
Tom is going to love living here .
there are vari@@ ous kin@@ ds of can@@ dy in that bow@@ l .
you thought I wouldn &apos;t notice ?
you had better go to the den@@ t@@ ist &apos;s .
I wouldn &apos;t ask you if it wasn &apos;t important .
my name is not &quot; you &quot; ; it &apos;s R@@ ic@@ ar@@ do .
I will visit Kyoto .
please give me two more of the red car@@ na@@ tions .

Tom is just jealous that we &apos;re having so much fun .
does anyone here speak Esperanto ?
I &apos;ve saved a lot of money .

I had to run to catch up with Tom .
my wife isn &apos;t beautiful . yours is .
Mary , why are you crying ?
P@@ eter has been trying to find a new apartment for some time .

I wanted to spend more time with Tom .

where have you been , Tom ?
sometimes it can &apos;t be avo@@ i@@ ded .
we &apos;ve decided not to buy that house .
my a@@ unt made me a new sk@@ ir@@ t .
I live in a country where the cost of a li@@ ter of gas@@ ol@@ ine is cheaper than the cost of a li@@ ter of water .

I &apos;m very pleas@@ ed to meet you .
who re@@ moved it ?
where is my diary ?
we haven &apos;t seen anyone .
get away from here !
Mary s@@ mil@@ ed for the camera .
I knew that already .
that could happen to anyone .
Tom didn &apos;t deserve that .
be careful .
Tom is a true artist .
let &apos;s not bo@@ ther Tom .
that &apos;s not saying a lot .
Com@@ p@@ et@@ ent people need not app@@ ly .
he is always it@@ ching for a fight .
I often played baseball when I was young .
I forgot to tell you what Tom said .
Tom has dis@@ appeared .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to be seen with Mary .
he lived in Ko@@ be for three years .

she &apos;s a lot older than he is .
I think that you &apos;re the one that I &apos;ve been waiting for for all these years .
I didn &apos;t believe a word my grandfather said .
Itali@@ an t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion is us@@ eless .
how long have you been in love with her ?
the problem is we don &apos;t have enough money .
I &apos;m feeling a little blue today .
Mary wants her mother &apos;s appro@@ v@@ al .
Tom asked to be cor@@ rec@@ ted .
I &apos;d like to have a glass of wine .
you were Tom &apos;s ac@@ comp@@ lice , weren &apos;t you ?
he told me that he had lost his watch .
even if they have a good wine men@@ u , I will not want to d@@ ine here .
I &apos;ll try , but I don &apos;t know for sure whether I &apos;ll be able to go to the c@@ in@@ em@@ a tomorrow or not .
you &apos;d better really love her ; people are un@@ ch@@ ange@@ able .
we &apos;ve said our g@@ ood@@ by@@ es .

I &apos;ll take my father &apos;s place .
the two children were of an age .
do you get the im@@ pression that all of our politi@@ ci@@ ans are too old ?
business people ex@@ change cards at the beginning or end of a meeting .
the red b@@ elt makes her bla@@ ck dress look even better .
would you mind if I ask you a person@@ al question ?
I don &apos;t want to believe that .
can &apos;t you hear the sound ?
you don &apos;t look like your da@@ d .
life is a great mi@@ ser@@ y .
Tom came to pick me up .
I am glad to hear the news .
he stayed up late .
C@@ anadi@@ ans are our friends .

U@@ to@@ p@@ ia today means a reali@@ sa@@ ble im@@ pos@@ sibility .
what &apos;s stop@@ ping us ?
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to like doing that .
I &apos;ll watch TV .
Tom and Mary told John that they were busy .
if I knew what the picture was going to be like I wouldn &apos;t make it . it was almost like it was made already . the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge is more about trying to make what you can &apos;t think of .
I have a big fa@@ vor to ask .
the house needs a new coat of paint .
I was happy for them .
Tom got tired soon .
Tom is ac@@ custom@@ ed to w@@ inning .
that &apos;s not what she was talking about .
H@@ y@@ dra@@ tion is cri@@ ti@@ c@@ ally important in hot weather .
OK , I &apos;ll order it .
my m@@ om told me that I was f@@ at .
I am a man who can &apos;t stand being alone .

Tom car@@ ed for his sick father .
I gave my vote to Ken .
Tom also speaks French .

education should not be a bur@@ den on the parents as well as on the children .
was that you in the car ?
they couldn &apos;t stop s@@ mil@@ ing .
do you know who those people are ?
I am afraid he will make a mistake .
you must hurry up .
why can &apos;t you go now ?
it would be better for you not to ask him for advice .
you and Tom have a lot in common .
my name is Tom and I &apos;m an alco@@ holic .
I want you to meet my c@@ ousin .
I don &apos;t want to be the one to tell Tom that .

take your shoes off .
Tom &apos;s first week on the job didn &apos;t go very well .
don &apos;t you have any sha@@ me at all ?
what made you su@@ spi@@ ci@@ ous ?
listen to me carefully , and you will understand what I really mean .
I can &apos;t go with you .
do you know the Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a we@@ b@@ si@@ te ?

my big sister was@@ h@@ es her hair every morning .
it isn &apos;t easy .
he &apos;s always jo@@ king .

Tom told me that he thought that Mary was un@@ consci@@ ous .
I talked to Mary today about what she plans to do .
I don &apos;t have a pen@@ cil .
we know that you lied to us the last time we spoke together .
the man fell down on the ground .
it &apos;s natural for him to get mad .
that &apos;s exactly what I thought .
I was moved by his tears .
I think it &apos;s time for me to shar@@ pen my pen@@ cil .
it was a very exc@@ it@@ ing game .
come on !
he gave us a deta@@ il@@ ed account of his experi@@ ences in Afri@@ c@@ a .
that must be my book .

nobody asked Tom .
we have to make up for lost time .
we didn &apos;t believe him .
I &apos;ve been re@@ que@@ sted to help you .

I don &apos;t mind shar@@ ing a room with her .
what is your blood ty@@ pe ?
Tom will be flying back to Boston on Monday .

let me teach you a better way to do that .
can I see it ?

why did you ab@@ an@@ don me ?
this t@@ ask took three hours .

she y@@ ell@@ ed at him .
do you know who wrote this book ?
Mary keep@@ s Tom &apos;s bra@@ in in a j@@ ar .

Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary there .
Tom stood there for a while .
the patient &apos;s descri@@ p@@ tions of her family are vi@@ vi@@ d , but very c@@ y@@ ni@@ cal .
I think that Mary is trying to se@@ du@@ ce Tom .
it &apos;s not the same thing .
that name doesn &apos;t ring any bel@@ ls .
I live in the house .
Mr O@@ ga@@ ta , the au@@ th@@ or of this book , used to be a newsp@@ ap@@ er@@ man .
that &apos;s what Tom says .
we &apos;ve got a visi@@ tor .
who would have thought around 19@@ 00 that in fifty years time we would know so much more and understand so much less .
these flowers are for Mary , not for you .
this kind of music makes me nerv@@ ous .
Tom didn &apos;t like being poor .
the lock is broken .
please bring your own cu@@ t@@ ler@@ y .
what I &apos;m telling you is true .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe that Mary had tri@@ cked him .
you know that &apos;s the truth .
you &apos;re my best custom@@ er .
this is going to be proble@@ mati@@ c .
I wish you the best of lu@@ ck .

Tom buried his face in his hands .
Tom loved Mary , you know .
there &apos;s a good restaurant not too far from here .
where did everybody go ?
what if you &apos;re wrong ?
Tom is the only one in our family who doesn &apos;t speak French .
she was dre@@ ssed in a red ba@@ thing suit .
I swim .
I don &apos;t recogni@@ ze it .
I obje@@ cted when the wai@@ ter tried to re@@ move my pla@@ te .
my father likes travel@@ ing by air .
if you want to succe@@ ed in life , work hard .
Oh ! I know the man .

would you like a second ser@@ ving ?
you should know it .
if it &apos;s not for s@@ ale , don &apos;t ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se .
Tom asked Mary about her new job .
the de@@ er is faster than it is strong .
you &apos;d have to be pretty stupid to do that .
that &apos;s very consi@@ der@@ ate of you .
did you sugge@@ st that to Tom ?
you know what I want .
Tom promised to be here before 2 : 30 a@@ .@@ m .
I don &apos;t really like her .
what &apos;s in all these bo@@ x@@ es ?
I want to see the movie again .
we could sing together .
if you want to see Tom , you have to hurry .
I may have hurt his feelings .
Tom , des@@ per@@ ate , ho@@ w@@ led : &quot; Mary ! where are you ? &quot; from the very left e@@ dge of the sentence . &quot; I fear I &apos;m from now on , fully at the op@@ pos@@ ite from you &quot; dri@@ ly re@@ t@@ or@@ ted Mary .
Tom talks fast .
Tom was ab@@ rup@@ tly wo@@ ken from his s@@ l@@ umber by loud ban@@ ging on the front door .
the pon@@ d is 3 met@@ ers deep .
he still sti@@ cks to his opinion .
I am playing vol@@ le@@ y@@ ball now .
what was his rea@@ ction to this news ?
French is de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely not the eas@@ ie@@ st language to learn .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was hon@@ est .
you may give the book to wh@@ o@@ ever wants it .
Tom says he &apos;s never done that .
Tom didn &apos;t want us there .
you knew it all along .

please don &apos;t spi@@ ll the be@@ ans to Eli@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th that I bought her a g@@ old ne@@ ck@@ la@@ ce for her birthday .
watch the road .
Tom didn &apos;t want to play tennis with Mary .
Tom and Mary said they wanted to do that by themselves .
my family loved Tom .
why are you doing shopp@@ ing here ? everything is expensive .
I don &apos;t like it when she does that .
that &apos;s consi@@ dered a s@@ in .
are you free this afternoon ?
I found this book very difficult .
Tom taught Mary how to ba@@ ke bread .
Tom and Mary told John that they didn &apos;t want Alice to do that .
I have known her since she was a little girl .
you don &apos;t have to go with Tom .
Tom was sleeping so@@ und@@ ly on the cou@@ ch .
I &apos;ve never da@@ ted anyone taller than me .
when Tom was a child , he went to Boston every summer to stay with his grand@@ parents .
Tom doesn &apos;t like the way Mary sin@@ gs .
Tom left his wife and children .
cats are smar@@ t .
I cer@@ ta@@ inly wouldn &apos;t do that .
do I owe you something ?
I don &apos;t want to make a big deal out of this .
he has a lot of con@@ fi@@ den@@ ce .
this fo@@ rest is quiet and pea@@ ce@@ ful .
I wish you the best of lu@@ ck .
Tom is a very good cook .
please remember to post the letters .
that &apos;s what brought us together .
H@@ ol@@ ly br@@ an@@ ches are often used for de@@ cor@@ ation at Christmas .
we arrived at a hotel in Rom@@ e .
I don &apos;t want you to make the same mistake I made .
I &apos;m not sure whether I really want that .
so fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; what .
my grandfather is f@@ on@@ d of taking a walk early in the morning .

do you want to go somewhere ? Tom &apos;s coming , too .
it &apos;ll take two hours to get there by bus .
I haven &apos;t apologi@@ zed to Tom yet .
do you think that those super@@ her@@ oes are en@@ do@@ wed with tal@@ ents we don &apos;t pos@@ s@@ ess ?
he has a nice in@@ come .
Tom is aller@@ gic to da@@ ir@@ y produ@@ cts .
we know what you &apos;re looking for .

I &apos;d rather walk than wait for a bus .
you will have to apologize when you see him .
it is quite natural for her to get angry .
Tom is a few in@@ ches sh@@ or@@ ter than Mary .
he ran across the street , leaving her alone .
Mary just got her hair done .
Vol@@ can@@ oes can be ac@@ tive , dor@@ m@@ ant , or ex@@ tin@@ ct .
Tom told me Mary wanted to see me .
the student coun@@ cil disc@@ ussed plans for the gradu@@ ation .

Tom talked with his friends yesterday .
Mary buried her face in her hands and so@@ bbed un@@ contr@@ ol@@ la@@ bly .
it &apos;s Tom &apos;s problem now .

we slept in a very small t@@ ent .
I really wasn &apos;t expecting that from you .
everything he says is correct .
he could not res@@ ist the temp@@ tation .
why didn &apos;t you come ear@@ li@@ er ?
gener@@ ally speaking , Japanese women are mo@@ dest .
you need to be pretty fit to run up six fli@@ ghts of stairs .
that looks so exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ in@@ gly boring .
I didn &apos;t realize it was so late .
my sister lives near Yo@@ ko@@ ha@@ ma .
she &apos;ll be apples .

Mary doesn &apos;t like par@@ sle@@ y .
these fa@@ cts ad@@ mit of no con@@ tradi@@ ction .
you can think of the rest yourself .
first , let &apos;s talk about what Tom did .
why isn &apos;t Tom doing that ?
a large crowd had ga@@ th@@ ered on the street .
Mary could tell by the way Tom slammed the door that he wasn &apos;t happy .
Tom now wears a wi@@ g .
she sin@@ gs in the cho@@ ir .
Som@@ eh@@ o@@ w , Tom knew .
is Kim J@@ ong ill or is Kim J@@ ong okay ?

just wonder@@ ing how you are doing .
in the old days , things were a lot simp@@ ler .
do you know how to use this mach@@ ine ?
Tom sat qui@@ et@@ ly star@@ ing at the fire .
give me something to write with .
the com@@ mit@@ te@@ e is made up of ten mem@@ bers .
the world began without man and it shall end without him .
I have made my decision .
good afternoon .
she met him for breakfast .
that would take too long .
everybody was ga@@ th@@ ered in the living room .
what &apos;re you going to do about these co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ach@@ es ?
it &apos;s not compli@@ cated .
did you just meet her ?
most people think so .
sit down on the ben@@ ch .
this large so@@ fa would be out of place in a small room .
tell me more .
year 201@@ 1 &apos;s most no@@ t@@ ori@@ ous ex@@ pression is &quot; Ke@@ ba@@ b mur@@ ders . &quot;
Tom wants to finish doing what he &apos;s doing before he goes home .
everyone thinks the same thing .
the more time I spend doing this , the less time I have to do things I enjoy doing .
Tom had to live with the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences of his ac@@ tions .
wait until tomorrow morning .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re tired already .
de@@ ar me , what pretty dan@@ cing @-@ shoes !

you tried to stop Tom from doing that , didn &apos;t you ?
where are they going to go ?
Tom wants to learn some French son@@ gs .
don &apos;t do anything you &apos;ll regre@@ t .
paper ca@@ tches fire easily .
how did you get to know that person ?
which sh@@ elf do you want me to put it on ?
Tom , be reas@@ on@@ able .
the good woman is making a sou@@ p .
here &apos;s my telephone number .
I met Na@@ om@@ i on my way home and we had a ch@@ at .
today I have an Esperanto class .
do you have a quiet place where you can do your homework ?
I don &apos;t like to talk about myself .
they saw a strange ani@@ mal there .
please get these p@@ ap@@ ers out of the way .
they have a very good cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um at that university .
I think it is mor@@ ally wrong to eat people .
I promise to call .
do you like por@@ k lo@@ in ?
we have to use the stairs because the ele@@ vat@@ or is out of order .
you &apos;re never satisfied .
Tom and I had a long conversation while we were waiting for Mary .
I don &apos;t want Tom to hear about this .
I didn &apos;t even get an inv@@ it@@ ation .
th@@ us I have heard .
a so@@ ci@@ et@@ y without reli@@ gion is like a ship without a comp@@ ass .
Tom is ble@@ e@@ ding .
how much in@@ toler@@ ance are we prepared to toler@@ ate ?
I wish I &apos;d had more time to pre@@ p@@ are .
don &apos;t make prom@@ ises you can &apos;t keep .
the house where we spent our first days is un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able . it is the best and most loved one . that is where my yo@@ un@@ gest sister learned to walk in De@@ c@@ ember . even the sm@@ alle@@ st cor@@ n@@ ers of every room e@@ vo@@ ke s@@ we@@ et memori@@ es .
the hou@@ se@@ bo@@ at is in the bo@@ a@@ th@@ ou@@ se .
she didn &apos;t exp@@ ose her sk@@ in to the sun .
that &apos;s not what you said before .
they did away with the old system .
his mother died when he was young , and his grandmother brought him up .
Pau@@ la was called away on ur@@ gent business .
you must on no account do such a thing .
she speaks H@@ eb@@ rew with her mother and Poli@@ sh with her father .
are you being bitten by m@@ os@@ quit@@ oes ?
Tom and I &apos;ve been friends for years .
that &apos;s not very rom@@ anti@@ c .

keep@@ ing a horse is a big respon@@ sibility .
she was eating a sand@@ wich .
Tom is sli@@ gh@@ tly under the weather today .
I have nothing to tell you at this moment .
Nep@@ tun@@ e has win@@ ds in its at@@ mosp@@ here which b@@ low at over 20@@ 00 k@@ ilom@@ et@@ ers per hour !
Tom hardly ever ac@@ ts his age .
what is it that you want me to do now ?
when he saw that there was nothing more to see , he took his bi@@ ke and ro@@ de home .
how is this possible ?
Mary gave Tom all the money she had on her .
she lives with her parents .
the che@@ mi@@ cal sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l H ex@@ press@@ es hy@@ dro@@ gen .
does this sentence make sense ?
boys have no respect for girls .
your plan seems excellent .
I su@@ spe@@ ct that Tom doesn &apos;t do his homework by himself .
what country are you from ?
we have to be careful who we show these plans to .
the people knew he did not like them .
sleep as long as you want .
the clothes horse is always in the way !
the rain today ma@@ tches my mood well .
I can &apos;t keep pa@@ ce with you .
he used to ha@@ unt those ca@@ ves as a little boy .
he &apos;s not thirsty .
I have a han@@ go@@ ver .
Tom should be here after lunch .
I have broken off our en@@ ga@@ ge@@ ment .
the beach was crow@@ ded with tou@@ ri@@ sts .
Er@@ r ...
many tou@@ ri@@ sts come to this is@@ land every year .
Tom sat on a ben@@ ch reading a book .
where is the P@@ ala@@ ce of F@@ ine Ar@@ ts ?
please leave my things as they are .
I didn &apos;t compla@@ in about anything .
the hal@@ l@@ mark of a so@@ ci@@ op@@ a@@ th is a la@@ ck of em@@ pa@@ thy .
thanks to you .
Tom suggested that we go swimming .
everyone has the right to take part in the go@@ vern@@ ment of his country , direc@@ tly or through fre@@ ely ch@@ osen re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves .
Tom has a viol@@ ent temp@@ er .
these apples are for Tom .
I &apos;m glad to hear that .
does he have gra@@ y hair ?
don &apos;t worry . this won &apos;t happen again .
I remember se@@ eing the movie before .
you look sa@@ d . what &apos;s wrong ?
forget your trou@@ bl@@ es for a while and come and have dinner with us .
she is a stran@@ ger to me .
you don &apos;t seem to have any problem communi@@ ca@@ ting in French .
he made an important dis@@ co@@ very .
I don &apos;t want you to quit what you &apos;re doing .
she con@@ cen@@ tra@@ ted on one thing .
we used em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy meas@@ ures to re@@ vi@@ ve the car@@ dia@@ c ar@@ rest patient .
he took char@@ ge of the ar@@ ran@@ gem@@ ents for the party .
I do not want to go to the th@@ eater .
better beautiful and rich than ugly and poor .
don &apos;t buy me anything !
Par@@ li@@ ament appro@@ ved the new law last week .
would you mind sen@@ ding this letter for me ?
will you look after my children for me ?
Tom has a dog .
it looks like you &apos;ve got a green th@@ um@@ b .

Tom says he did not mean to kill her .
I sent it yesterday ; you should recei@@ ve it tomorrow .
I hope that you &apos;ll help me .
I count on your help .
please don &apos;t be angry !
Mr. Ta@@ ka@@ ha@@ sh@@ i gave us some homework .
the chair@@ s are made of a sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic material .
let &apos;s get dr@@ unk .
I saw a hu@@ ge dog lying in front of Mr H@@ ill &apos;s house .
it seemed never @-@ ending .
that &apos;s dangerous !
we understand why .
there is nothing as important as friend@@ ship .
may I leave my phone number ?
who gave you that ?
I don &apos;t expect anything from Tom .
I &apos;ll introdu@@ ce you my brother .
those books were on di@@ sp@@ lay in the window .
the decision is ours to make .
he had breakfast all alone .
you &apos;re un@@ belie@@ v@@ able .
take your time . it &apos;s a mar@@ a@@ th@@ on , not a sp@@ r@@ int .
I can neither con@@ fir@@ m no@@ r den@@ y this .
it &apos;s a mi@@ ra@@ cle that he wasn &apos;t killed in the accident .
you can still change your mind .
Tom thinks Mary isn &apos;t here .
you should tell your mother as soon as possible .
the stre@@ ets are alive with shopp@@ ers .
Tom is going to do that again .
it &apos;s not like it used to be .
you &apos;d better not stay up too late .
it &apos;s possible Tom and Mary are rela@@ ted .
he &apos;s such a wi@@ mp .
they saw it as the bra@@ ve act of a strong man .
Tom says he has no vi@@ ces .
we remember .
I &apos;m waiting for a rep@@ ly .
they told jo@@ kes about some of his movies .
I can v@@ ou@@ ch for Tom &apos;s work . he is really good at what he does .
you should look that word up .
can &apos;t you leave me alone ?
put the car into the gar@@ age .
a squirrel suddenly came running out of no@@ where .
what would German be without comm@@ as !
I met an American girl .
Mary &apos;s the la@@ zie@@ st of her sch@@ o@@ ol@@ ma@@ tes .
I like to listen to clas@@ si@@ cal music while I work .
close the window .
how on earth could Tom have known that ?
I don &apos;t need your help .
I agree with you .
I &apos;d never let you kiss me .
I &apos;ve already memori@@ zed your phone number .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
he hel@@ d his brea@@ th .
what &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
Ar@@ men@@ ia jo@@ ined the Wor@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de Or@@ gani@@ z@@ ation in 20@@ 0@@ 3 .
my dau@@ g@@ ther wants a kit@@ ten .
thank you all the same .
I cannot c@@ ross this river . it &apos;s too wi@@ de .
the au@@ th@@ or doesn &apos;t di@@ sp@@ lay much talent in his book .
I &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be deli@@ gh@@ ted to see you .
when was the last time you was@@ hed the car ?
I went there .
he likes to talk about himself .
I saw the house .
all work has been car@@ ried out by exper@@ ts .
he bo@@ wed to me as he passed by .
I &apos;ll take care of that myself .
there is no point in giving him advice .
he is my brother , not my father .
they are the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor .
Al@@ le@@ ge@@ dly every language is lear@@ n@@ able .
the car is e@@ qui@@ pped with dig@@ it@@ ally contr@@ oll@@ ed air con@@ di@@ tion@@ ing .
he is on the point of death .
all coun@@ tries have their em@@ bas@@ si@@ es in the cap@@ ital .
I won &apos;t go to school tomorrow .
Tom and Mary told John that they didn &apos;t think Alice was alone .
you &apos;ve run out of things to drink .
this ugly yellow reminds me of the col@@ or of your bed@@ she@@ ets .
he climbed M@@ t . Fu@@ j@@ i .
the m@@ otor@@ c@@ ycle I bor@@ row@@ ed from him broke down .
do you see that cu@@ te guy over there ?
are there any lan@@ d@@ mar@@ ks ?
Tom owns a thir@@ teen @-@ ac@@ re f@@ arm .
Tom thought Mary was asleep .
no one will believe you .
why do we always have to go to Boston , Tom ? there are other beautiful ci@@ ties !
I can &apos;t even speak English very well , much less Spanish .
tell Tom I &apos;m looking forward to meeting him .
I need a b@@ ig@@ ger ch@@ air .
earth has moun@@ tains , fore@@ sts , fiel@@ ds , animals and people .
I &apos;m running out of ideas .
I &apos;m surprised to see you .
she has enough will@@ power .
his argu@@ ment was bas@@ ed on fa@@ cts .
I don &apos;t want to be a fif@@ th whe@@ el .
how many friends do you have on Facebook ?
Oh , the stre@@ et@@ lights have turned on .
Tatoeba is a dictionary .
we &apos;ve known each other for more than thirty years .
I &apos;m cold . may I close the window ?
she is an@@ xi@@ ous about your health .
Tom loved sports .
your idea sounds like a good one .
have you ever gone bow@@ ling with Tom ?
it wouldn &apos;t do any good to compla@@ in about it now .
Tom looked like he was ready to jum@@ p out a window .
Mary knew that Tom had over@@ heard John and her talking about him .
M@@ at@@ the@@ w drea@@ ded all women exc@@ ept Mar@@ ill@@ a and M@@ r@@ s@@ . R@@ ach@@ el ; he had an un@@ comfor@@ table feeling that the my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous c@@ rea@@ tures were secre@@ tly laughing at him .
what is it that bo@@ thers you ?
Tom was finished doing that by 2 : 30 .
Tom fo@@ ol@@ ed all of us .
I want to wash myself .
Tom is still in Boston .
I &apos;m tired of being re@@ tired .
he gave me his word .
it happens all the time .
Tom looks great , doesn &apos;t he ?
do you want your money in co@@ ins ?
he was put up for ado@@ ption .
my e @-@ mail address has been changed .
the river flo@@ ws into the se@@ a .
have you seen the new house that Mar@@ il@@ y@@ n lives in ?
two co@@ ffe@@ es , please .
I want to be with my family .
I prepared a weak su@@ gar solution .
Tom climbed up the ro@@ pe .
I don &apos;t know three languages .
I can &apos;t speak French .
be careful ! the knife is very shar@@ p .
I didn &apos;t dream last night .
he is drea@@ ming of be@@ coming an a@@ stronaut .
wh@@ en@@ ever I see him he reminds me of my late grandfather .
what if she doesn &apos;t like me ?
I &apos;m sel@@ fish .
could you do that ?
may I inter@@ ru@@ pt you ?
could you put these in a box ?
I &apos;m not sure what Tom is trying to say .
my parents p@@ us@@ hed me to quit the baseball clu@@ b .
I hate driving .
did you enjoy the sal@@ ad ?
if that wasn &apos;t Tom , who was it ?
I have no des@@ i@@ re to do that .
he climbed the stairs .
Tom hand@@ ed Mary the letter op@@ ener .
I think it &apos;s OK .
are you still at home ?
I don &apos;t drink beer .
I plan to go to France next year .
you &apos;ll like this .
I &apos;ll pick you up at noon .
you don &apos;t want this , do you ?
Tom never seems to want to sleep .
she was gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely worried about him .
why did you stea@@ l your grandmother &apos;s je@@ wel@@ ry ?
Tom is still over@@ weight .
have you really talked to Tom ?
I went to the station .
Tom ga@@ ined weight .
the super@@ market didn &apos;t have what I wanted .
I &apos;ll never see her again .
all you have to do is sign this paper .
you understand more than me about this s@@ ort of thing .
I cannot tell you how dis@@ gu@@ sted I felt with myself when I reali@@ zed what I was doing .
Tom is up@@ stairs pa@@ cking .
Tom &apos;s consci@@ ous .
I can &apos;t understand why he did that .
it is not what you read but how you read it that coun@@ ts .
it &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve seen you smile .
after it ra@@ ins and the ground is da@@ mp , it &apos;s eas@@ ier to pu@@ ll wee@@ ds .
Tom can &apos;t explain what happened .
is his father alive ?
he received quite a few letters this morning .
Tom didn &apos;t tell us what happened that night .
ask Mary if she has enough money to buy what she needs .
I didn &apos;t know the truth until yesterday .
Pro@@ du@@ c@@ tiv@@ ity is the emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e &apos;s most important char@@ ac@@ teri@@ stic .
she was hom@@ es@@ ick .
I don &apos;t parti@@ cul@@ arly want to do that .
you want to do that work .
when you have something to say , count to ten before saying it .
I bought a sand@@ wich .
I ate .
Tom can &apos;t re@@ ti@@ re .
how was your hon@@ ey@@ moon ?
there are many ear@@ th@@ qua@@ kes in Japan .
I &apos;ve seen the way she looks at you .
Tom invited Mary to jo@@ in him and his family for dinner .
he &apos;s Tom &apos;s ch@@ au@@ ffe@@ ur .
I &apos;m alone now .
it wasn &apos;t that hard .
I &apos;ve never told anyone before .
it &apos;s certain that Geor@@ ge will come .
it probably would be cheaper somewhere else .
Mary and Alice both used to be Tom &apos;s girl@@ friends .
I me@@ ant to look it up .
I do not have much time .
I think I &apos;m a pretty good writer .
he won &apos;t turn up tonight .
the lea@@ ves have be@@ gun to change col@@ ors .
the effe@@ ct was immedi@@ ate .
the work must be comple@@ ted by tomorrow .
he &apos;s on his way .
let Tom do this .
Tom is a fire eater .
Tom has a lot of friends in Boston .
a well @-@ made cup of coffee should re@@ qui@@ re no cream or su@@ gar .
Jane kept silent for a long time .
that &apos;s a photo of my sister .
I broke a s@@ we@@ at running on the trea@@ d@@ mi@@ ll .
please phone him .
now would be a good time .
Tom already did that .
she learned English with great ea@@ ger@@ ness .
we must pun@@ ish him sever@@ ely .
I &apos;ll call the police .
I &apos;m not sure right now .
the joke los@@ es everything when the jo@@ ker laugh@@ s himself .
Tom came to help .
I haven &apos;t read the report .
will the police come ?
my brother sen@@ ds you his warm regar@@ ds .
who should I vote for ?
didn &apos;t I tell you to close the door ?
Tom didn &apos;t expect Mary to be so friendly .
Tom and Mary walked out of the class@@ room .
I ma@@ jo@@ red in che@@ mi@@ str@@ y when I was in college .
Europe has more cul@@ ture !
O@@ pp@@ os@@ i@@ tion to the em@@ bar@@ go was gro@@ wing .
I don &apos;t think Tom tried hard enough .
Tom read a lot .
three years is a long time , I feel .
the re@@ sul@@ ts were a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing .
Tom said it wasn &apos;t necessary .
don &apos;t forget that it &apos;s Tom &apos;s birthday tomorrow .
I ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge you to a fight .
who is your favorite com@@ pos@@ er ?
the U.@@ S@@ . president &apos;s pas@@ sp@@ ort is bla@@ ck , not blue like an a@@ ver@@ age ci@@ ti@@ zen &apos;s .
maybe she knows the answer .
they told me I had to help you .
whose books are these ?
Tom and Mary only speak French to their children .
I do want to do the si@@ ghts of Kyoto .
that is in my re@@ colle@@ c@@ tions .
have you learned to drive a car ?
I don &apos;t know why you listen to him .
I am sorry to hear that .
J@@ es@@ us ha@@ tes you .
a g@@ ala@@ x@@ y con@@ tains not only star@@ s , but cl@@ ou@@ ds of gas and d@@ ust .
Tom said that he thought that he might be allowed to do that again .
it &apos;s a sha@@ me you don &apos;t speak F@@ inn@@ ish .
Tom has done something stupid .
there was no ir@@ ri@@ tation on his part .
the acc@@ used thief is on tri@@ al now .
China is a maj@@ or econom@@ ic power , with one of the fa@@ stest gro@@ wing econom@@ ies in the world .
Tom didn &apos;t know anyone in the room .
is it open ro@@ und the clock ?
you &apos;ll have the report on your desk first thing in the morning .
Tom and Mary c@@ lin@@ ked their glasses together .
keep@@ ing the suit on , D@@ im@@ a walked out of the chan@@ ging room and sta@@ ted that he wanted to make the pur@@ ch@@ ase .
Tom doesn &apos;t like hot food .
we were reading a book and it was a very good one .
we both fell asleep .
&quot; would you mind op@@ en@@ ing the window ? &quot; &quot; of course not . &quot;
last Sat@@ ur@@ day , my family went to the zo@@ o to see the p@@ an@@ das .
the pas@@ s@@ word is &quot; Mu@@ i@@ rie@@ l . &quot;
those prison@@ ers were set free yesterday .
what &apos;s that very tall building ?
I don &apos;t want that and I know you don &apos;t want that either .
you are expected to dress well for this shop .
Tom and Mary disc@@ ussed their future plans together .
I &apos;m f@@ ed up with your con@@ st@@ ant compla@@ ining .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was exc@@ ited .
he has already had lunch .
why don &apos;t you have one ?
I decided to tell him that I love her .
I have to know why .
Tom became angry .
did you recogni@@ ze your old class@@ mate ?
I &apos;m of the opinion that he should apologize to his teacher .
I like to play the piano .
this is quite difficult for Tom .
they aren &apos;t rela@@ ted .
what was done to you doesn &apos;t excuse what you did .
the children are already tired .
do you drink alco@@ ho@@ l ?
after three drinks , the man passed out .
please open the door .
Tom probably wants to eat some Chinese food .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go anywhere else .
what have you come here for ?
the au@@ to in@@ du@@ str@@ y is hi@@ ring again .
Tom found the key he had been looking for .
I cannot fi@@ x the computer .
I really liked the movie .
having disc@@ ussed the new project for three hours , we conc@@ lu@@ ded that An@@ dre@@ w &apos;s plan was the best .
I miss my children .
I can &apos;t stand her jeal@@ ous@@ y .
this will re@@ qui@@ re a hu@@ ge inv@@ e@@ st@@ ment of time and money .
it was very difficult to convin@@ ce Tom .
you &apos;re the love of my life , and you will be forever .
I should move to Boston .
the game ended at n@@ ine o &apos;clock .
the g@@ or@@ ill@@ a was one year old at the time .
what part of C@@ anada are you from ?
how much is this tie ?
I sent you a new e @-@ mail .
take care le@@ st you should fall .
listen carefully to me .
I che@@ ered myself up by listening to music .
Tom is not an easy person to get along with .
my lunch brea@@ k &apos;s almost over .
I can &apos;t remember who arrived first .
we &apos;re having breakfast .
don &apos;t give this to anybody .
Mary eats less than her sister does .
Tom and Mary told John that they were happy .
I should &apos;ve known Tom would be here , too .
I hate chess .
we enjoyed se@@ eing the city , but we got a little tired .
can you tell me how ?
no one is rich enough to buy back his own past .
the b@@ om@@ b atta@@ cks forever de@@ stro@@ yed coun@@ t@@ less hi@@ stor@@ ic buil@@ d@@ ings which had stood for cen@@ tu@@ ries .
I don &apos;t know if I can ever trust you again .
what do you think of my new hat ?
they enter@@ ed the j@@ un@@ gle .
a co@@ w ch@@ as@@ es away fli@@ es with its ta@@ il .
she used to be so full of jo@@ y .
Jane always beha@@ ved like she was very rich .
my job is teaching English .
what do you call this ve@@ get@@ able in English ?
many young people are out of work in that country .
our two her@@ oes having deser@@ ted this sentence , their adv@@ ent@@ ures seemed to be willing to end pre@@ c@@ is@@ ely with this word .
what made Tom do that ?
I will not buy this record , it is s@@ cra@@ t@@ ched .
I sometimes write to Tom .
the students I teach are good .
I saw five plan@@ es taking off , as if they were birds .
please give me an as@@ h@@ tra@@ y .
please put it back in its place .
she told him a joke , but he didn &apos;t lau@@ gh .
she is busy at present and can &apos;t speak to you .
may I sit next to you ?
he gave me a h@@ ug .
all Tom told me was that he wouldn &apos;t be at the meeting .
my hands are cold .
she is sh@@ y and talks little .
I am from Tokyo , Japan .
nobody owns the moon .
Tom has an in@@ cu@@ ra@@ ble di@@ se@@ ase .
cho@@ ose one person .
we met in winter .
I knew Tom would do something rom@@ anti@@ c .

these pictures are beautiful .
it &apos;s lon@@ ely in the sa@@ ddle since the horse died .
La@@ y@@ la decided to stay .
the tree thro@@ ws a sha@@ do@@ w on the grass .
doesn &apos;t Tom go to Boston every month ?
it is fun to speak in English .
are you busy now ?
I want to give my old desk to Tom .
look out for cars when you c@@ ross the road .
Y@@ ere@@ v@@ an is the cap@@ ital of Ar@@ men@@ ia .
I hate watching TV .
how did you come by such a job ?
I should have read the in@@ sur@@ ance poli@@ cy more carefully .
I &apos;ll buy you a new one .

who did you give it to ?
he had a strong ali@@ b@@ i .
the c@@ loud was in the sha@@ pe of a bear .
we have to make sure we get there on time .
he kissed every pretty girl at the party .
I don &apos;t know how else to say it .
you &apos;ll never guess what I saw this morning .
Tom was left alone .
the un@@ stop@@ p@@ able mar@@ ch of time continu@@ es .

I have no ap@@ pe@@ ti@@ te .
the man con@@ fes@@ sed that he had ro@@ bbed the old woman .
Tom mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ously sur@@ vi@@ ved .
I don &apos;t want to hear about all your e@@ x @-@ boy@@ friends .
a lot of villa@@ gers were killed by sol@@ di@@ ers .
my little brother wanted to read that com@@ ic you l@@ ent me the other day , so I &apos;ll be re@@ tur@@ ning it after he &apos;s done .
you shouldn &apos;t read other people &apos;s pri@@ v@@ ate letters without per@@ mis@@ sion .
when she enter@@ ed the room , he stood up .
it &apos;s great when you &apos;re in love .
do you know how much it c@@ osts ?
he had a job inter@@ view in English .
he began to sing .
is Tom there , too ?
I gave her some can@@ dy .

the hou@@ ses along the river are very old .
you &apos;re not as good as you think you are .
Tom has decided to keep a diary this year .
eat the fruit before it goes bad .
Tom asked me if I had ever done that .
Tom is a good husband and a good father .
but he wanted a son very much .
I can &apos;t bear that f@@ ellow .
prices are going up .
in my opinion , stre@@ ss @-@ free learning is the most effe@@ ctive .
he gave an account of his trip .
he dis@@ appeared without a tra@@ ce .
ever since I learned about the exi@@ st@@ ence of the university , I wanted to go there .
Tom and Mary told John that they were disc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged .
the lo@@ com@@ o@@ tive was pu@@ ll@@ ing a long line of frei@@ ght cars .
this p@@ ear sm@@ ell@@ s nice .

I &apos;m not in Boston .
they went ice @-@ sk@@ ating together .
do you have to go now ?
cer@@ ta@@ inly he is handsome and intelli@@ gent , but there is something about him that I can &apos;t like .
he is a handsome man .
we &apos;re talking about who we should hi@@ re .
Tom has lots of friends to help him .
Tom is im@@ poli@@ te .
it &apos;s exc@@ it@@ ing .
are you going to do something about it ?
that boy is Tom .
I didn &apos;t want to leave before the work was comple@@ ted .

she is colle@@ cting on be@@ half of the blind .
I don &apos;t know what he &apos;ll do .
Tom will be thir@@ teen next month .
what does Tom look like ?
how old do you think Tom is ?
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to be as toler@@ ant as Mary seems to be .
one day I met him .
Tom and Mary told John that they were innocent .
I won &apos;t den@@ y that .
Tom and I see each other every day .

E@@ mily is a student .
Tom used to do that a lot .
it &apos;s as cold as ice .
do you know the reason ?
I have no idea where we are .
do you know what that means ?
do you know why he wasn &apos;t at school ?
I &apos;m looking for a book about me@@ di@@ e@@ v@@ al Spa@@ in .
it &apos;s time to eat lunch .
fin@@ is@@ hing the job by T@@ u@@ es@@ day will be a piece of cake .
I had to pay 5 dollars in ad@@ di@@ tion .
it &apos;s part of life .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t alone .
what was it that Tom said that made Mary so angry ?
what &apos;s Australia &apos;s popu@@ la@@ tion ?
we need it ba@@ dly .
what &apos;s your name ?
the only language I can speak flu@@ ently is English .
apple see@@ ds are po@@ is@@ on@@ ous , but are only dangerous to health when con@@ su@@ med in large quanti@@ ties .
I was a fool to trust Tom .
the band is still together .
did Mary say why she &apos;s going to Boston ?
don &apos;t ever men@@ tion his name again .
it &apos;s bas@@ ic@@ ally quite simple .
what have you put into your bag ?
I &apos;d love to meet Tom .
these are great .
I &apos;m sick of eating fast food .
I have never been to Fl@@ ori@@ da .
have you visited a zo@@ o in your country ?
the c@@ em@@ eter@@ y needs to be moved to a new lo@@ cation sou@@ th of the town .
let me give you a h@@ ug .
there &apos;s no sense ac@@ ting all tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ant like a con@@ qu@@ er@@ ing her@@ o over such a min@@ or thing .
may I call on you some day ?
he stopped reading a book .
the question fo@@ xed me completely .
I sometimes dream of home .

my God ! I left the wallet in my room !
I told you the concert was going to be boring . why didn &apos;t you believe me ?
you don &apos;t seem too enth@@ u@@ si@@ a@@ stic .
she was th@@ ri@@ ll@@ ed with his pre@@ sen@@ ce .
Tom is in no hurry to sell his car .
Tom ad@@ mit@@ ted that he was scared .
he left Japan on a fine day .
did you know Tom is very good at playing bas@@ ketball ?
there are things in this world which simp@@ ly cannot be ex@@ pressed in the form of words .
are you on the com@@ mit@@ te@@ e ?
we know what happened next .
it &apos;s difficult for me to solve this problem .
the sta@@ dium was quite still .
I like no@@ o@@ d@@ les .
it was Jane who came first .
Tom only wears br@@ and @-@ name clothes .
M@@ r@@ s@@ . Sp@@ en@@ cer lived in a big yellow house at White San@@ ds C@@ o@@ ve .

she went from one shop to another .
I can &apos;t write , and I can &apos;t read either .
the book is on course re@@ ser@@ ve .
she knows how to com@@ b her hair .
Tom is a good gu@@ itar@@ ist .
we &apos;ll kill you .
time for bed .
Tom isn &apos;t here . he &apos;s already left .
I want to eat k@@ im@@ ba@@ p .
if you have finished reading the book , re@@ turn it to the library .
I don &apos;t know that .
we want to take it .
Tom went down the river on a ru@@ b@@ ber ra@@ ft .
she will fa@@ il even@@ tually .
can you explain why ?
her friend is a singer .
how did you know what she wanted ?
that respon@@ sibility is a bur@@ den to him .
how are you ?
Tom has a big nose .
there &apos;s a big party at his place .
so the doctor started to exam@@ ine her .
&quot; jum@@ p across the di@@ tch . &quot; &quot; I will if you will . &quot;

wait , you guys .
I had an eg@@ g sand@@ wich for lunch .
Tom usually only wears his glasses when he &apos;s reading .
she left her son a lot of money .
Tom went out .
hard work en@@ ab@@ led him to get good mar@@ ks .
I wish you were here .
by the time you get out of pri@@ son , she &apos;ll be married .
since Tom &apos;s Ta@@ ver@@ n has started off@@ er@@ ing a deli@@ very ser@@ vice too , it has been f@@ loo@@ ded with phone call@@ s .
you took it out of the o@@ ven too soon .
Tom has apologi@@ zed for his comm@@ ents .
this woman is not from Sy@@ ri@@ a .
it &apos;s bad for business .
Tom went direc@@ tly to his room as soon as he got home .
does that mean something ?
he gave his life for his country .
&quot; did you kill Mary ? &quot; &quot; no , I did not . &quot;
make a pre@@ di@@ ction .
Dol@@ p@@ hin@@ s are so@@ cial animals .
did that uncle of his often visit America ?
I couldn &apos;t put up with that noise any longer .
never mind Tom .
it happens more often than you would think .
I tried to force myself to stay awake .
do you know anyone who &apos;s gone to Boston ?
Tom is ob@@ s@@ es@@ sed with An@@ ci@@ ent E@@ gy@@ pt .
Tom bought a new case for his sa@@ x@@ op@@ h@@ one .
I am inv@@ e@@ sting money into this v@@ ent@@ ure .
I don &apos;t know what Tom &apos;s talking about .
are you taking the p@@ iss ?
everything he said was right .
turn them on .
Tom for@@ ced open the door with a crow@@ bar .
I really want to see Ku@@ mi@@ ko .
this is news to me .
the sta@@ te@@ ment was not ti@@ m@@ ely .
the kitchen in that house is very nice .
she bor@@ row@@ ed one of his T @-@ shi@@ r@@ ts .
the children are playing hide @-@ and @-@ see@@ k .
today is the 20@@ th of October .
do you really think that your plans are reali@@ stic ?
my mother asked me not to fe@@ ed the dog until after we had all eaten .
there is a man at the door who wants to see you .
he &apos;s here to sp@@ y on us .
where did you two meet ?
he gave me back the change .
where did you learn to dance like this ?
he could not take examination on account of his ill@@ ness .
do we really need it ?
what makes you think that Tom &apos;s interested in hel@@ ping us ?
I &apos;m sick of eating fish .
these p@@ ill@@ ars supp@@ ort the sta@@ ge .
I gave my word to Tom that I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom and Mary are almost finished doing that .
in English the ver@@ b pre@@ ce@@ des the object .
you haven &apos;t heard the half of it yet .
he &apos;s an early bird .
he &apos;s crazy about me .
as far as the eye could see , nothing could be seen exc@@ ept cor@@ n@@ fiel@@ ds .
did Tom say anything before he died ?
Tom even@@ tually decided to do that .
it &apos;s a war crime .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done what you say he did .
I like com@@ ic books .
Tom sear@@ ched his memory .
everything will turn out fine .
the Ber@@ l@@ in wall was built to pre@@ v@@ ent E@@ ast Ger@@ m@@ ans from fle@@ eing to the We@@ st .
Tom thought he had all the time in the world .
you look bored .
I can &apos;t afford to eat in such an expensive restaurant .
his younger brother went to S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i the day before yesterday .
Tom &apos;s as bald as a ba@@ d@@ ger , but he had a full head of hair when he was young .
she has an ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary ab@@ i@@ lity in music .
we can for@@ give , but for@@ getting is impossible .
I never wanted to do this .
what else do you need ?
Al@@ low me to introdu@@ ce Ma@@ y@@ u@@ ko to you .
I &apos;ll never see Tom again .
if you want to dance , let &apos;s dance together .
and in the Indi@@ an O@@ cean , some is@@ lan@@ ds of the M@@ al@@ di@@ ves will dis@@ app@@ ear completely ben@@ ea@@ th the water .
Tom spent the better part of the day writing an arti@@ cle for a lo@@ cal ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine .
I hate to con@@ tradi@@ ct you .
Tom asked me if I wasn &apos;t feeling well .
Mary swi@@ ms as fast as Ja@@ ck .
Tom said he &apos;d never been in a m@@ otor@@ bo@@ at .
you need to be careful .
the ca@@ ve is easy to acc@@ ess .
what im@@ pression do you have of China ?
you &apos;ve been through a lot , haven &apos;t you ?
I need a knife .
it &apos;s a bit in@@ timi@@ da@@ ting .
perhaps Tom can help you find a job .
have you ever told me the truth ?
the h@@ eat doesn &apos;t seem to bo@@ ther Tom at all .
I dro@@ ve Tom to the hospital .
who caught Tom ?
I can do it in a week .
you had better put on your c@@ ras@@ h hel@@ met .
give some meat to the dog .
he passed the exam .
you must be more careful about sp@@ elling and pun@@ c@@ tu@@ ation .
can we have a moment alone ?
there are a few nu@@ clear b@@ om@@ b sh@@ el@@ ters in the city .
he &apos;s already a man .
she gre@@ et@@ ed me poli@@ tely .
&quot; what was that ? &quot; &quot; nothing . &quot;
the fish was not fre@@ sh .

Tom is co@@ ck@@ sure .
the children were swimming na@@ ked .
we know we &apos;ve got big problems .
Tom became blind .
I will learn .

Tom told Mary to come back later .
Tom needs you here .
Tom has already started .
of course they &apos;re fas@@ ci@@ sts .
I met your parents yesterday .
this matter is of great import@@ ance .
I think Tom would di@@ sag@@ ree .
you are completely right .
that is why I was late for class yesterday .
this photo is too bl@@ ur@@ ry . I can &apos;t make out your face .
someday the new re@@ sear@@ ch work will be comple@@ ted .
Tom will get over it .
Tom ho@@ pes that he can visit Boston before he dies .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re sleep@@ y .
that wasn &apos;t necessary .
it is no use preten@@ ding you know nothing about it .
you put far too much pe@@ pp@@ er in it .
I ba@@ ked him some bro@@ w@@ ni@@ es .
E@@ met sat at my bed@@ side for ten hours .
what time is good for you ?
I think Tom and Mary are thirsty .
the mo@@ on@@ light re@@ fle@@ cted on the lake .
she dan@@ ced all night long .
how can you have a l@@ ap@@ top , but no mo@@ bi@@ le ?
she has to come .
they don &apos;t know that I &apos;m Japanese .
two @-@ thir@@ ds of the students came to the meeting .
I got a fl@@ at ti@@ re .
strong lea@@ der@@ ship was needed .
why aren &apos;t we doing that ?
cli@@ ck on &quot; sa@@ ve &quot; to begin the down@@ lo@@ ad .
I never learned how to write .
Mary told Tom she wanted John to teach him how to do that .
very simple was my ex@@ plan@@ ation , and p@@ lau@@ sible enough - as most wrong the@@ ori@@ es are !
they continu@@ ed the exper@@ iment day and night .
don &apos;t be crazy .

Tom and Mary ate Chi@@ cken K@@ ie@@ v .

Mary is a tal@@ en@@ ted ac@@ tress .
I didn &apos;t touch anything .
he couldn &apos;t see very far because of the fo@@ g .
what are you doing here ? why aren &apos;t you at home ?
I can keep a secret .
the prison@@ er was brought before a ju@@ dge .
let &apos;s go !
I just got here .
I can &apos;t di@@ stin@@ gu@@ ish a fro@@ g from a to@@ ad .
I am spee@@ ch@@ less .
I don &apos;t think that anybody really under@@ stands me .
I didn &apos;t have the heart to tell him .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to college .
Tom got ki@@ cked out of school .
you live in a little house .
I got him to stop smoking .
Tom is much better at French than me .
I &apos;m staying at the Hil@@ ton Hotel .
now I recogni@@ ze you !
this is the first time I &apos;ve ever par@@ ked my car in the w@@ oo@@ ds .

don &apos;t worry .

I &apos;m leaving .
I like to read before I go to bed .

I had no@@ where to hide .
I wonder if I can ad@@ d a sentence .
it &apos;s quite warm today .

it would &apos;ve been nice if Tom had told us he &apos;d be late .
&quot; who is this Tom ? &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a char@@ ming young man I met a few days ago . &quot;
the fin@@ al plan diff@@ ers grea@@ tly from the orig@@ in@@ al one .
all the pas@@ sen@@ gers got se@@ as@@ ick during the stor@@ m .
Unfortunately , Tom wasn &apos;t there .
that is the most I can do .
I &apos;m on the way home .

she is un@@ willing to accept respon@@ sibility .
the ki@@ d@@ nap@@ per@@ s showed no sign of giving up .

I always need an ex@@ tr@@ a b@@ lan@@ ket in the w@@ inter@@ time .
do you have it by any chance ?
don &apos;t you have a sense of ju@@ sti@@ ce ?
could you please say that once again in French ?
do I have to study ?
one American sci@@ ent@@ ist , W@@ illi@@ am Ke@@ et@@ on , used a very interesting exper@@ iment to solve this my@@ ster@@ y .
the trees were in a row .
I remember her face , but I don &apos;t remember her name .
you must get up at six .
Tom doesn &apos;t know much about music .
he would give an arm and a leg for that .
I &apos;ve asked you this question before .
Tom has th@@ ick hair .
I want to spend the whole day with you .
Tom hasn &apos;t answered my letter yet .
do you know who said that ?

hello G@@ i@@ a@@ da , tell us your story , we &apos;ll listen to you .
after you , Tom .
look at the picture .
let &apos;s keep this matter to our@@ selves .
Tom didn &apos;t think he was com@@ mi@@ tting a crime .
Tom worked very hard today .
I &apos;m sorry . I won &apos;t do it ever again .

do you like coffee ?
you &apos;re over@@ weight .
Tom had a cold .
Tom is a very experi@@ en@@ ced anno@@ un@@ cer .
just go back to the kitchen .
Tom doesn &apos;t drink much .
I could have done that for you .
I asked Tom and Mary what happened , but they wouldn &apos;t tell me .
this glass con@@ tains water .
how are you now ?
Tom wanted a word with Mary .
all the kids I grew up with could swim before they started going to school .
call me when you get there .
I know him quite well .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
you should wear a coat .
we &apos;re like a big family here .
as a result of always being hungry and fa@@ ti@@ gu@@ ed , that dog finally died .
Tom was famous .
there is no escape from fa@@ te .
he does not know .
it could happen to you , too .
do you notice anything different about Tom ?
people often take me for my brother .
I already feel much better .
if you drive your car like that , you &apos;ll end up in hospital .
I &apos;ll ask Mary out .
do not ask what life gi@@ ves you , ask what you give .
Tom was trying to kill Mary .
I &apos;m just ki@@ dding .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
I was in@@ volved in a traffic accident .
I really wasn &apos;t expecting that from you .
I can@@ c@@ el@@ ed my ap@@ poin@@ tment because of ur@@ gent business .
I don &apos;t want you to ring me up all the time .
do you want to give up ?
Tom is married to a teacher .
he arrived very early this morning .
I know Tom is a ra@@ c@@ ist .
this mach@@ ine was man@@ u@@ fa@@ c@@ tu@@ red in France .
I really enjoyed this book .
the a@@ er@@ op@@ lan@@ e was just taking off .
what would you do if another war o@@ cc@@ ur@@ red ?
don &apos;t talk to your mother like that !
Tom told me to leave the room immediately .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything about you .
don &apos;t be so su@@ spi@@ ci@@ ous .
do you know exactly where H@@ ann@@ i@@ ba@@ l crossed the Al@@ ps ?
there wasn &apos;t a dr@@ y eye in the house .
Tom looks un@@ convin@@ ced .
today is fu@@ cking cold .
the rich@@ est man in the world cannot buy her love .
it was he that broke the window yesterday .
Tom thought the used car sal@@ es@@ man was trying to ri@@ p him off .
be fair .
does Tom study after dinner ?
I &apos;m Brazi@@ li@@ an .
take the ca@@ tal@@ o@@ gue , open it , and call out the ten@@ th word on the right side .
Ma@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ en@@ a and An@@ ia are good friends .
it goes without saying that health is more important than we@@ al@@ th .
do you understand what you &apos;ve done ?
the s@@ ale of cigaret@@ tes should be b@@ ann@@ ed .
Tom was too tired to walk any fur@@ ther .
clean the room .
would you like me to car@@ ry your suit@@ case for you ?
both of them are busy .
C@@ ran@@ es are big beautiful birds .
a woman appeared from behind a tree .
he told me that he was married .
I &apos;m glad you invited me .
how did you find out that Tom hadn &apos;t paid his b@@ ills ?
you must not be late for school .
cer@@ ta@@ inly .
you can smoke here .
is that singer popu@@ lar am@@ ong your friends ?
he plays the guitar .
Tom is lying ill in bed .
this di@@ sh is terri@@ fi@@ c .
maybe we should ask Tom if he wants this old piano .
the first les@@ son is easy .

I can &apos;t repa@@ ir the computer .
I have a fan@@ cy for bit@@ ter things .
are these your daughters ?
can some@@ body get that ?
Tom saw mu@@ d@@ dy foot@@ prin@@ ts on the floor .
Tom and Mary told John that they liked doing that .
where &apos;s my desk ?
are you saying Tom isn &apos;t happy ?
we had lunch .
I didn &apos;t get a chance to visit the art mus@@ e@@ um .
this student is American .
tell D@@ ad to come .
I didn &apos;t know you had company .
Mary wasn &apos;t the first one who said she didn &apos;t want to do that .
no matter what they tell me , I still plan to go to Boston on Monday .
Tom could be in the gy@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ i@@ um .
we had much snow last winter .
do you know why Tom didn &apos;t win ?
maybe I &apos;ll just give up soon and take a na@@ p instead .
Se@@ wa@@ ge often p@@ oll@@ u@@ tes the o@@ cean .
I have trouble getting along with Tom .
mar@@ ri@@ age is the uni@@ on of a man and woman .

I like foot@@ ball .
who &apos;s this Tom you always talk about ?
she is a well @-@ known singer .
I grew up on watching Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ on .
Tom is now tru@@ ly on his own .
at last we meet ! I &apos;ve waited so long for this day !
the students ch@@ ose her chair@@ man .
I have to give a class tomorrow at 2 : 30 .
get out of my car .
I got a C on my last French test .
I &apos;ll leave the book for you with my neigh@@ b@@ our .
my father is taking a walk in the park .
I &apos;ve been thinking about something .
John does not want to answer the question .
you know why , don &apos;t you ?
Tom likes playing soccer .
his de@@ bt a@@ moun@@ ted to a consi@@ der@@ able s@@ um .
have you tried it before ?
there is a lot of fur@@ nit@@ ure in his room .
we have to leave now .
it wasn &apos;t in Paris that we met .
the tie doesn &apos;t go with my suit .
have you meas@@ u@@ red it ?
the thief ran fast .
if Tom had more money , he &apos;d do that .
I might be your only friend .
hurry up , and you &apos;ll catch the train .
what &apos;s Tom &apos;s favorite food ?
are you guys from Au@@ stri@@ a , or is it Australia ?
trust people , but don &apos;t take can@@ dy from stran@@ gers .
he has a gun .
we are looking for a house with a gar@@ age .
the weak are food for the strong .
she lives next door to us .
Tom said he had to go somewhere .
we know all that .
let &apos;s pret@@ end we are ali@@ ens .
how can Tom not understand that ?
he was born poor , but died a milli@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ re .
if that happens , give me a call .
there are only two so@@ ckets in the meeting room .
if you can trans@@ late the sub@@ ject and object then after that it isn &apos;t so difficult .
you can &apos;t understand this sentence , can you ?
isn &apos;t that what I said ?
it &apos;s beginning to take form !
I hear you have friends in the C@@ I@@ A .
please ad@@ vi@@ se me on what to do .
Mary isn &apos;t as ac@@ tive as her sister .
I watched TV last night .
Mary is Tom &apos;s st@@ ep@@ mother .
Tom was dis@@ loy@@ al .
it &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
if you have finished reading the book , re@@ turn it to the library .
what a shot !
it was not you who ate the cake I made , it was your sister .
I had the boy car@@ ry my bag .
you can wait here .
Tom is the same age as Mary .
it won &apos;t just happen over@@ night .
have you written all the New Y@@ ear &apos;s cards already ?
she married a fi@@ re@@ fi@@ ghter .
I need to talk to you about an ur@@ gent matter .
people who love doubt nothing , or doubt everything .
Tom has a picture of his dog on his desk .
Tom stood up .
my ci@@ gar went out . will you give me a light ?
Tom kept star@@ ing .
I &apos;ll have two hot dogs with mu@@ star@@ d and ket@@ ch@@ up .
what have I missed ?
straight away , Mary put the wa@@ ff@@ le ir@@ on she had won to use .
could you take me to this seat ?
I can &apos;t let you go in there alone .
write Tom .
Tom may be old , but he &apos;s in good sha@@ pe .
you can close your eyes to re@@ ality but not to memori@@ es .
you won &apos;t have any more trouble with Tom .
when did you get to know her ?
was the baby crying then ?
how long have you been watching them ?
Tom never wears red .
they are inse@@ par@@ able .
he bought an English book at a book@@ store .
Tom is often late for school .
they &apos;ll grow .
Qu@@ e@@ sti@@ on@@ ing received wi@@ s@@ dom is the driving force behind pro@@ gre@@ ss .
Tom was wonder@@ ing what it was that dra@@ gge@@ d her so , to@@ war@@ ds the end of all sentences and thought : &quot; come to me , Mary ! &quot;
I didn &apos;t know Tom had a sports car .
this is my room . you can &apos;t just bar@@ ge in like that !
I prefer a cot@@ ton bl@@ ou@@ se .
Tom has been doing a pretty good job of el@@ u@@ ding the police , but even@@ tually he &apos;ll get caught .
I paid c@@ as@@ h for the car .
I saw tears in his eyes .
the fact is ap@@ par@@ ent to everybody .
men are so us@@ eless .
it needs ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se .
we &apos;ve sli@@ ced the tom@@ a@@ toes .
fa@@ sten your seat b@@ elt , please .
it is not given to everybody to study abroad .
get me my food .
too many people are in@@ different to politi@@ cs .
did the police ar@@ rest Tom ?
Tom was home .
the building on the hi@@ ll is our school .
Tom is re@@ mor@@ se@@ ful .
Tom slept on the floor that night .
I &apos;m not a good be@@ ach@@ com@@ ber . I only pick up pie@@ ces of broken glass where others colle@@ ct co@@ ins and things .
excuse me , may we sit here ?
Tom was bar@@ ely alive when we found him .
she has a ter@@ ror of dar@@ k@@ ness .
I &apos;ve never seen a more enti@@ cing woman than the one standing in front of me right now .
when da@@ d came home , I was watching t@@ v .
Tom was arrested the same day .
Tom and Mary told John that they were hurt .
the m@@ os@@ quit@@ oes are anno@@ ying .
do you really want me to go there right now ?
H@@ ick the w@@ ood@@ cu@@ tter cu@@ ts w@@ ood .
she kept working .
do you know of a good mo@@ tel in the ar@@ ea ?
I &apos;m not sure I can trust you .
Tom has been sick in bed all week .
John is interested in g@@ olf .
cop@@ y this , please .
Tom had some g@@ um stu@@ ck on the bottom of one of his shoes .
an a@@ ff@@ ine al@@ ge@@ bra@@ ic grou@@ p over a fi@@ eld k is a re@@ pre@@ sent@@ able co@@ vari@@ ant fun@@ ctor from the ca@@ teg@@ ory of com@@ mu@@ ta@@ tive al@@ ge@@ br@@ as over k to the ca@@ teg@@ ory of grou@@ ps such that the re@@ pre@@ sent@@ ing al@@ ge@@ br@@ a is fin@@ it@@ ely gener@@ ated .
this clock is mine .
we are the country of c@@ low@@ ns ?
you aren &apos;t allowed to do that .
the stat@@ es@@ man is wor@@ thy of respect .
Tom was des@@ per@@ ate to escape .
this book is written in a rather simple English and is th@@ us suit@@ able for beg@@ inn@@ ers .
give me that camera .
I cannot thank him enough .
Tom answered my question .
Tom is just sitting on the por@@ ch , doing nothing .
do you take work home with you ?
m@@ os@@ quit@@ oes in M@@ inn@@ es@@ ot@@ a are as big as stor@@ ks .
I already told my parents .
Tom told Mary how he and John met .
Tom looks as though he wants to cry .
Tom has one son and two daughters .
my house is ha@@ un@@ ted .
he can &apos;t cook very well .
come and help me out .
you cannot have your own way in everything .
could we please go home now ?
the fin@@ al ma@@ tch was not so exc@@ it@@ ing .
what a great idea !
Tom &apos;s new camera can take ima@@ ges with much high@@ er pi@@ x@@ el coun@@ ts than his old one could .
I &apos;ll ask you these questions .
he took to A@@ ki@@ ko from the moment he met her .
we don &apos;t have that infor@@ mation .
Tom and I &apos;ll be in the lo@@ b@@ by waiting for you .
my je@@ ans s@@ hr@@ ank in the wash .
I wish we could go back to the way things were before .
he asked her some questions .
I &apos;d like to vol@@ un@@ te@@ er my ser@@ vi@@ ces .
don &apos;t let him get away .
Tom &apos;s right .
Tom fro@@ ze to death .
last night , I recor@@ ded all the sounds I made while I was sleeping .
you must be the change you wish to see in the world .
it is not acc@@ ep@@ table to our mor@@ al co@@ de .
I kind of lost my fo@@ c@@ us .
I simp@@ ly don &apos;t know what to say ...
I must get it fi@@ xed .
this book is far above me .
since I was little I have loved going to the se@@ a with my family .
do you think you &apos;re o@@ be@@ se ?
C@@ on@@ gre@@ ss passed the bill .
we &apos;re going to name him Tom .
they say he &apos;s the best tennis pla@@ yer .
how can I tell it just to Tom without telling everybody else ?
have you already made friends with her ?
Tom didn &apos;t know what was going on .
answer me !
everyone in the car said they wanted to get out and stre@@ tch their legs .
I want to be an a@@ stronaut .
a r@@ at ran across the road .
how is this even possible ?
I cannot do the work on my own .
sometimes I wish I had a t@@ win brother . that &apos;d be fun .
such a tri@@ vi@@ al thing is out of the question .
I sat in the waiting room for what seemed like hours .
Mary immediately recogni@@ zed his voice . it was Tom !
how many people are in this room ?
these ty@@ pes of books have almost no v@@ al@@ u@@ e .
there &apos;s still a lot to do .
should S@@ cot@@ land be an in@@ dependent country ?
Tom will be free tomorrow .
how I wish I could go , too !
his eyes failed him .
Tom couldn &apos;t remember what Mary had told him to do .
we plan@@ ted pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts instead of cot@@ ton .
it looks like you had a t@@ ough day .
E@@ ro@@ s is the Gre@@ ek go@@ d of love .
she made no respon@@ se to my question .
there &apos;s nothing to be done about it .
he made his way through the crowd .
Tom &apos;s well .
I re@@ comm@@ end Tom .
I &apos;m a beg@@ inner , too .
Tom bought a car us@@ ing his sa@@ v@@ ings .
he can be proud of his father .
get out of bed !
I go to school on foot .
Tom pre@@ fer@@ s dogs to cats .
don &apos;t come near me . I have a cold .
I &apos;d do anything for her .
Wo@@ e be@@ ti@@ de the child who speaks correct English ; he will be the laughing @-@ sto@@ ck of his class@@ ma@@ tes .
you have to be ac@@ tive .
I would very much appreci@@ ate recei@@ ving a cop@@ y of the book .
he is doing a su@@ per job .
Liisa and Mar@@ k@@ k@@ u are enti@@ rely different in tem@@ per@@ ament and con@@ stan@@ tly at si@@ x@@ es and se@@ v@@ ens .
he studi@@ es the Bi@@ ble .
you can see the S@@ ky@@ tree from there .
it &apos;s not true .
I &apos;m not very op@@ timi@@ stic .
Tom called Mary a tra@@ it@@ or .
it was too late .
an American G@@ over@@ n@@ ment cannot per@@ mit Americans to star@@ ve .
last year in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ in@@ es , ear@@ th@@ qua@@ kes and ti@@ da@@ l wa@@ ves re@@ sul@@ ted in the dea@@ th@@ s of more than 6@@ ,000 people .
air p@@ oll@@ u@@ tion is a serious problem in this country .
we &apos;re not sure where Tom is .
this road is too n@@ ar@@ row for cars to pass .
the shirt is very dirty . before you go to school , it has to be was@@ hed .
I believe that stri@@ c@@ ter vi@@ g@@ il@@ ance is necessary here .
o that I had so much power !
you ought not to have said a thing like that to him .
kiss Tom for me .
I want to know why you lied to me .
I &apos;m not really very thirsty .
I can only tell you what I know .
I &apos;m good at tennis .
do you like it then ?
please be quiet .
how cle@@ ver !
try it once again .
he came late , as is often the case with him .
I don &apos;t have enough money for my trip .
Tom was bitten by a dog .
I &apos;m bored to death .
no , you may not put the col@@ ander on your head ; you can be an a@@ stronaut after I d@@ rain the pa@@ st@@ a .
Tom ate something .
the old man lost his will to live .
you can &apos;t leave me here alone with Tom .
I &apos;m doing this for them .
she thinks she &apos;s a gen@@ i@@ us .
he was ac@@ ting really wei@@ r@@ d .
do you know what they want ?
Tom suff@@ ered from a heart atta@@ ck and almost died waiting for the am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce .
I like to watch TV .
I can &apos;t spend the rest of my life living with Tom .
I &apos;d like to play tennis with you .
he cannot speak English , much less German .
it &apos;ll rain soon .
come home .
where does Tom have to do that ?
I &apos;m still un@@ decided .
I bought two cot@@ ton shi@@ r@@ ts .
don &apos;t han@@ g up , but h@@ old on please .
she is sin@@ ging the la@@ test popu@@ lar son@@ gs .
in gener@@ al , men are taller than women .
how long have you two been en@@ ga@@ ged ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to lose some weight .
a decision will be even more difficult the longer you del@@ a@@ y it .
I think Tom is smar@@ ter than Mary .
I always conf@@ use which side is port and which star@@ bo@@ ard .
this book@@ store stopped sel@@ ling J@@ U@@ M@@ P .
I &apos;m afraid not .
whatever she told you , it &apos;s not true .
Tom has finished un@@ pa@@ cking his suit@@ case .
Tom used to help his father in the store after school .
he made up his mind to write in his diary every day .
she began to cry .
ho@@ we@@ ver cold it may be , he still jo@@ gs 20 k@@ ilom@@ et@@ ers every day .
Tom was still a ba@@ ch@@ el@@ or then .
that &apos;s my favorite shirt , and I always wash it by hand .
I wish I could help you .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was dep@@ end@@ able .
I had a hea@@ da@@ che .
he is a good boy , and he is very strong .
Tom speaks excellent French , but his English isn &apos;t very good .
I was wo@@ unded by her comm@@ ents .
you need to mind your own business .
he was at home .
it &apos;s Tom &apos;s turn to help wash the di@@ sh@@ es .
I can be@@ at Tom .
only a third of the students came to class today .
suddenly , something un@@ expected happened .
and then everyone started laughing .
do you believe in ange@@ ls ?
I can do it without you .
you are hear@@ ing things .
Tom saw a girl sitting all alone , so he went over to talk to her .
I asked Tom if he was nerv@@ ous .
when do you want to meet Tom ?
I bar@@ ely had time to finish this report before the meeting .
I went to Na@@ gas@@ ak@@ i .
Tom &apos;s had a lot of girl@@ friends .
Tom never compla@@ ins .
please leave me alone . I am busy .
I could spend hours in here .
our cat &apos;s f@@ ur has lost its lu@@ ster .
Tom has been in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated since 2013 .
you &apos;re absolutely right !
this story does not make sense !
my feet are k@@ ill@@ ing me .
do you have a map of Boston ?
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary thought of it .
I thought you might be cu@@ ri@@ ous .
that evening I left my ti@@ p under a coffee cup , which I left up@@ side down on the table .
I &apos;d rather die than do what you &apos;re asking me to do .
this is the tri@@ cky part .
I don &apos;t give a fu@@ ck about what you think .
some boys came into the class@@ room .
a dog is a loy@@ al ani@@ mal .
Mary is mad at me because she thinks I stole her boyfriend .
I left the window open .
so far as I can remember , there is not one word in the G@@ osp@@ els in pra@@ ise of intelli@@ gen@@ ce .
be con@@ t@@ ent with your lot ; one cannot be first in everything .
which is cheaper , the bus or the street car ?
been there , done that .
when was the last time you slept in this room ?
the qu@@ arre@@ l had un@@ fortun@@ ate con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences .
what will I forget to write ?
did you already do your homework ?
Tom seems to be de@@ pressed .
above all , fa@@ me means dying at the right time .
my mother sp@@ ends a lot of money on clothes .
I &apos;m sure Tom was in@@ volved .
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bus@@ h .
then , the train s@@ cre@@ e@@ ched to a halt .
it &apos;s a phone call from a Mr Brown .
who wrote these letters ?
I study French , too .
it &apos;s open .
the person on the left ru@@ ins the b@@ al@@ ance of the picture .
Tom wouldn &apos;t believe me .
I &apos;ll write Tom a letter .
I wish you weren &apos;t always so busy .
Tom looked very young .
he is Ra@@ mu@@ du .
the rain hasn &apos;t stopped yet , has it ?
you can &apos;t do this to yourself .
it was a new experience for her .
where there &apos;s life , there &apos;s hope .
Tom died three days after he arrived in Boston .
don &apos;t you have to go to school today ?
did you clean your room ?
what scared you ?
how does she do this ?
is that your sister ?
Tom has some advice for us .
E@@ st@@ on@@ ia has its own na@@ tion@@ al an@@ them .
he dec@@ ei@@ ves others with his appear@@ ance .
I can &apos;t help but feel par@@ tly responsible .
I don &apos;t feel good about it .
now it &apos;s your turn .
I believe in the re@@ sur@@ rec@@ tion .
Tom is in police cu@@ sto@@ dy now .
I would like to have a look at your colle@@ ction of sta@@ mp@@ s .
n@@ one of us saw Tom and Mary do that .
were you able to make it to the station on time to catch the first train this morning ?
she &apos;s hon@@ est enough , but can you really trust her ?
he drank the wh@@ isk@@ y as if it were water .
Tom ra@@ ised his glass and said , &quot; T@@ o the happy couple ! &quot;
how come you &apos;re so crazy ?
thanks , M@@ om .
Americans under the age of eigh@@ teen aren &apos;t allowed to vote in pre@@ si@@ den@@ ti@@ al elec@@ tions .
we were able to catch the last train .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m a man .
why don &apos;t you answer your da@@ d ?
does it often snow in the winter here ?
I &apos;m sorry . I forgot .
is the patient prepared for sur@@ ger@@ y ?
he at@@ temp@@ ted to clim@@ b the f@@ ence to no ava@@ il .
the truth kno@@ cked the brea@@ th out of him .
his car was seriously da@@ ma@@ ged .
Tom said Mary is ready .
why didn &apos;t you try the dress on before you bought it ?
anybody is better than nobody .
OK , I &apos;ll order it .
I don &apos;t care for sports .
the boy who wri@@ tes best w@@ ins the pri@@ ze .
he has cor@@ por@@ al &apos;s stri@@ pes .
a man who la@@ cks res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness is us@@ eless .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to change Mary &apos;s mind .
the day is short and there &apos;s a lot of work .
Tom got here on time .
I can &apos;t stand this kind of movie .
where do I get off ?
G@@ or@@ ill@@ as cannot use their li@@ ps and ton@@ gu@@ es to speak , but they can communi@@ ca@@ te with people in other ways .
do you think French is difficult ?
how d@@ are you talk about Tom like that !
Unfortunately , an er@@ ror has o@@ cc@@ ur@@ red .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was hungry .
have you kissed her yet ?
Tom ba@@ cked out at the last moment .
I am laughing at Tom .
I have hun@@ dre@@ ds of such exam@@ ples in my computer .
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting .
please move the ch@@ air . it &apos;s in the way .
Mary first came to Boston when she was three years old .
don &apos;t s@@ cre@@ w with me !
is your car new ?
get out of the kitchen .
our poli@@ cy is to satis@@ f@@ y our custom@@ ers .
will you pass me the s@@ alt , please ?
you don &apos;t have to talk to me if you don &apos;t want to .
Tom thought about what Mary had said .
Tom and Mary told John that they were ready to leave .
I can not understand the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ y of ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ents .
all gro@@ wn @-@ up@@ s were once children .
do you think Tom saw it ?
Tom can swim no more than a st@@ one can .
I &apos;m fin@@ is@@ hing my homework .
you should school yourself to be patient .
the store was rela@@ tiv@@ ely emp@@ ty .
why should I pay ?
how can someone who knows the language so well have such a th@@ ick ac@@ cent ?
kno@@ wing a to@@ pi@@ c is one thing , but teaching it is a whole no@@ ther story .
he gets mad very easily .
the only time he fe@@ e@@ ds the dog is when his wife is away on a trip .
I &apos;m impressed with how much you &apos;ve impro@@ ved .
I don &apos;t get the con@@ ne@@ ction .
it &apos;s time to get up .
he was way behind on his rent . as a result , he was e@@ vi@@ cted from his apartment .
I like coo@@ ki@@ es .
please give me back my pen .
the voice re@@ min@@ ded me of my mother .

I &apos;m sure you me@@ ant well .
Ar@@ che@@ olog@@ y re@@ ve@@ als the secre@@ ts of the past .
your spee@@ ch is not at all under@@ stand@@ able to me .
I was waiting for you .
I would like to go to Japan .
she married an American .
we still have pl@@ enty of time left .
it &apos;ll be hard to convin@@ ce Tom to help us .
com@@ pu@@ ters are con@@ stan@@ tly being impro@@ ved .
where &apos;s my family ?
you aren &apos;t allowed in here .
if I had a choice , I &apos;d go home now .
he loves her , but she doesn &apos;t like him .
there are still some un@@ answered questions .
she asked me if I knew Tom &apos;s address .
he promised he &apos;d help us .
Tom left the room without saying a word .
he made up the story .
I think you &apos;d better talk to her .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy about it .
Sami was free to do whatever he wanted to do .
Tom still sometimes studi@@ es French .
you &apos;ve known Tom a lot longer than I have .
Tom is stu@@ ck in ja@@ il because he can &apos;t afford ba@@ il .
we &apos;re par@@ t@@ n@@ ers in crime .

she &apos;s inse@@ c@@ ure and has low self e@@ ste@@ em .
the acc@@ used thief is on tri@@ al now .
he is watching my every move .
he has a big house on the mountain .
love is strong , but money is stron@@ ger .

we walked along the sh@@ ore of the lake .
Tom could come with me if he wants to .
he is bu@@ si@@ er than Tar@@ o .
Mr. Ko@@ i@@ zu@@ m@@ i talks end@@ l@@ ess@@ ly without stop@@ ping .

after ten mon@@ th@@ s of very hard work , sometimes working through the night in an un@@ hea@@ ted d@@ om@@ e , C@@ l@@ y@@ de T@@ om@@ b@@ au@@ gh dis@@ covered an object he named P@@ lu@@ to .
that &apos;s not what I &apos;m looking for .
without water , there &apos;s no life .
I have been to Kyoto station to see my father off .
the thief fl@@ ed without leaving any tra@@ ces .
that is your last chance to take back what you said !
he ran to@@ ward me as fast as he could .
Mary said she didn &apos;t have a dog .
Tom ste@@ pped forward to kiss Mary , but she ste@@ pped back .
why does everything happen to me ?
don &apos;t eat the fruit in the bow@@ l on the table . it &apos;s pla@@ stic .
I know exactly what you &apos;re talking about .
what do you want to get Tom for Christmas ?
first find out her name and address .
I was put to great in@@ con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence .
one thing hasn &apos;t changed .
when did he fall ill ?
here she is !
I can afford good food now .
Tom wanted to learn how people in other coun@@ tries live .

Ti@@ gh@@ ten the s@@ cre@@ ws .

I am not a li@@ on but I too can ro@@ ar .
that was true for Tom , too .
I am your ser@@ v@@ ant .
he is always che@@ er@@ ful .
you should always turn off the light when you leave a room . this can sa@@ ve a lot of en@@ erg@@ y .
he stopped talking .
Tom wants to be a la@@ w@@ yer .
he &apos;s a grou@@ ch .
I &apos;ve never heard that before .
I don &apos;t know why you &apos;re here .
I really do miss my parents a lot .

I &apos;m not invited to par@@ ties .
father la@@ id his hand on my sh@@ oul@@ der .
this medicine does not agree with me .
our life absolutely changed in Boston .
Tom ref@@ used to pay the bill .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t speak French .
the heart is lo@@ cated in the che@@ st .
I guess you &apos;ve been to Boston before .
he asked me if I &apos;d help him .
why doesn &apos;t he tell me jo@@ kes anymore ?
Tom is the head sci@@ ent@@ ist .
when did you first meet Tom ?
it &apos;s a good poli@@ cy .

a pen@@ ny saved is a pen@@ ny ear@@ ned .
you are expected to pass the exam .
I am not gu@@ il@@ ty !
I dream of going to Li@@ th@@ u@@ an@@ ia and living there .
they called the dog C@@ oo@@ kie .
Tom called me at home .
she wants to talk to you .
if it were not for your advice , I would be at a loss .
what I have to tell you is very important .
are you sure you don &apos;t want me to help you out ?
Tom is from a rich Boston family .
do you have brothers and si@@ sters ?
I don &apos;t necess@@ ari@@ ly agree with everything I say .
you know where Tom is , don &apos;t you ?
please stop laughing .
she is an@@ xi@@ ous about your health .
can you i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ y the cause of the problem ?
when Tom finally decided to come out of the clos@@ et , everyone already knew he was ga@@ y .
he rarely went there .
I didn &apos;t sh@@ oo@@ t anyone .
you won &apos;t believe what happened to me today .
Tom doesn &apos;t know French .
Tom cra@@ w@@ led out from under the table .
what am I supposed to eat ?
the man was@@ hing the car is Mr. J@@ ones .
Tom has been to Boston a number of times .
Australia is the lar@@ gest country in the world without bor@@ ders with any other country .
I didn &apos;t understand anything , either .
I love him ... I think .
Tom looked around the room .
where did Tom go ?
my lights are on full be@@ am .
you can get it at any book@@ sel@@ ler &apos;s .
Tom spent thirty years in pri@@ son .
if I weren &apos;t broke , I &apos;d buy it .
I don &apos;t want to deal with this problem now .
is there s@@ alt left ?
I did what I could . it &apos;s your turn now .
a loud kno@@ cking at the door woke him up .
are you a student ?
what if we get caught ?
I can &apos;t explain anything .
Tom took a picture of himself fle@@ x@@ ing his ab@@ s in front of the mi@@ r@@ ror .
F@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ y is often the mother of art .
the garden is really a si@@ ght for sor@@ e eyes .
Tom didn &apos;t do much work today .
I like fish better than meat .
Tom made noise .
it &apos;s really time something was done .
we often played house in the park .
have you ever travel@@ ed by air ?
how often do you take a shower ?
so many ta@@ sty foo@@ ds can be prepared with eg@@ g@@ plan@@ ts !
how many su@@ ici@@ des do you think there are every year in Japan ?

Tom is lo@@ ving .
I ac@@ ted in accor@@ dance with my own con@@ vi@@ ction .

I &apos;m sure that was her .
well , then , if you want me to I &apos;ll do it .
he &apos;s a lan@@ d@@ lu@@ b@@ ber .
she &apos;s wearing sun@@ glasses .
Tom told me not to open that door .
you were correct .
she explained the reason why she was late .
Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice was innocent .
she &apos;s only two years old , but she can already count to 100 .
what do you want them to do ?
please keep this money for me .
she had no obje@@ ction .
I need an answer now .
I &apos;d rather die than sur@@ ren@@ der .
Alice will tell you that in W@@ on@@ der@@ land everything is to@@ p@@ s@@ y @-@ tur@@ vy .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go there alone .
give me the car key , please .
you can &apos;t hand@@ le it .
I will noti@@ f@@ y Tom .
the im@@ mi@@ gran@@ ts dream of having a new , better life .
let &apos;s get started .
the only reason Tom went to the party was that he expected Mary to be there .
I &apos;m sure Tom and Mary don &apos;t want to be the ones responsible for doing that .
why do you need to read such a book ?
Tom ! bring me a sand@@ wich .
what is the probab@@ i@@ lity that at least two students have the same birthday ?
P@@ fir@@ sich@@ ba@@ eu@@ m@@ chen is from Germany .

I &apos;d like you to meet my son .
I can tell when you &apos;re lying .
it has been raining on and off since this morning .
she was right and he was wrong .
whatever happens happens .
aren &apos;t you listening ?
Tom and Mary are now divor@@ ced .
you have to take off your shoes before enter@@ ing a tradition@@ al Japanese house .
Tom was often late for school .
bring your children along .
I &apos;ll never do anything by hal@@ ves .
Tom &apos;s got an an@@ aly@@ tical mind .
he won many com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tions .
it &apos;s pretty ugly .
if you had left a little ear@@ li@@ er , you would have avo@@ i@@ ded the heavy traffic .
the cat is drinking .
would you like to go for a walk ?
I want to know more about Tom &apos;s bi@@ ologi@@ cal parents .
I like to play soccer .
the station is to the we@@ st of the hotel .

we want to see the king .
can I try this on ?
I have no person@@ al h@@ os@@ ti@@ lity to the system .
Tom works for an Itali@@ an company .
I need a lea@@ ther ja@@ cket .
I don &apos;t intend to do what Tom told me to do .
English is a sister language of German .
we can &apos;t even be certain that it was Tom &apos;s voice we heard .
I want to hear it again .
life is de@@ ar to everybody .
why was I never told about this ?

Tom probably doesn &apos;t know whether he needs to do that or not .
talking to Tom is like talking to a bri@@ ck wall .
Tom has re@@ je@@ cted our offer .
where are you going this afternoon ?
yesterday was the first day of au@@ tu@@ m@@ n .
I got here as fast as I could .
everything you have will have you someday .
nobody loves me .
even at that early age the other children could probably tell there was something wrong , des@@ pi@@ te the fact that I never su@@ spe@@ cted anything of the s@@ ort ; and this was to be the case for a long time to come .
Bei@@ j@@ ing is chan@@ ging so r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly .
we disc@@ ussed what to do .
Tom was afraid that Mary would say no .
Unfortunately , it ra@@ ined yesterday .
I thought Tom lived in Boston .
our city is free from air p@@ oll@@ u@@ tion .
the mach@@ ine again made the usual noise and pr@@ inted out the following an@@ aly@@ s@@ is .
she was a ze@@ al@@ ous wor@@ ker for char@@ ity .
my dress doesn &apos;t fit anymore !
why are you so nice to everyone ?
the thought of not ris@@ king something fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ s me to death .
a president is like a c@@ em@@ eter@@ y mana@@ ger . he has a lot of people under him , but no one li@@ stens .
it &apos;s all Gre@@ ek to me .
what you call love is nothing more than just attra@@ ction .
does this bus go to the train station ?
I &apos;m convin@@ ced that my son is innocent .
Tom stayed at home .
shall I call Ken back ?
I love my tiger du@@ ck . he is quiet , but loy@@ al .
I need a moment alone with Tom .
I think you &apos;ve been lied to .
by wh@@ om was the company fo@@ unded ?
&quot; are these your books ? &quot; &quot; no , they &apos;re not mine . &quot;
what do you plan to maj@@ or in at college ?
I just got prom@@ ot@@ ed .
Tom slammed the door behind him .
the pain was such that I was not able to sleep .
I don &apos;t think Tom is a bad boy .
the point is that they are hungry .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
the dogs bar@@ ked all night .
what &apos;s that you &apos;re working on ?
what are you doing tonight ?
those ci@@ ties have uni@@ form traffic la@@ ws .
Tom asked for a raise .
a fi@@ er@@ ce ba@@ ttle was f@@ ought by the sol@@ di@@ ers .
Lon@@ es@@ om@@ e Geor@@ ge , the last rema@@ ining t@@ or@@ to@@ ise of his kind , died of un@@ known c@@ aus@@ es .
we are at home today .
you know him better than I do .
I didn &apos;t buy that car .
you &apos;re star@@ ting to p@@ iss me off .
Tom and Mary were sitting on the so@@ fa very close to each other .
there &apos;s no sentence with # 2@@ 6@@ 4@@ 4@@ 0@@ 5 .
he &apos;s very nice !
what did they ar@@ gue about ?
it was a very good experience for him .
Tom got bored after fif@@ teen minutes .
I doubt if this shop will ever pay its way .
no human power can man@@ age that .
Kyo@@ ko is lying on the grass .
you must be back on S@@ un@@ day at the la@@ test .
Tom ho@@ ped the rain would stop before he had to walk home .
my father died when I was se@@ ven .
you look upset .
everybody has their favorite drink .
does anyone know Tom &apos;s family name ?
are you looking for this ?
the ch@@ ea@@ p prices temp@@ ted me to buy things I didn &apos;t need .
today &apos;s weather fore@@ ca@@ st pro@@ ved right .
she is a good deal older than he .
you &apos;re sp@@ ending too much time worrying .
do you really think money will bring you happ@@ iness ?
who looks after the children ?
Tom was looking for something to eat .
you have an e @-@ mail message in your in@@ box .
she was really satisfied .
don &apos;t mind if I do !
Mary speaks with Tom &apos;s mother every day .
Tom is with her .
Tom and Mary wanted to be left alone .
this room is well fur@@ n@@ ished .
she looked out of the window .
what &apos;s happened ?
Tom walked across the street .
they aren &apos;t alone .
his re@@ ele@@ ction seems sure .
she came into the room .
before you leave home , make sure your p@@ ets have enough food .
the no@@ te is em@@ b@@ os@@ sed with the school em@@ blem .
his horse jumped over the f@@ ence .

all is over .
my sister will be thir@@ teen years old next summer .

Tom sin@@ gs well .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
I &apos;m here . what do you want ?
does Tom have gra@@ y hair ?
he &apos;s rich , though un@@ friendly .
it &apos;s hardly raining at all .
the rum@@ or must be true .
&quot; really ? &quot; &quot; Yes , really . &quot;
I think it &apos;s better you stay here until the snow stop@@ s .
I don &apos;t have a son named Tom .
OK , I understand .
he is a very la@@ zy boy .
it is dark in that room .
I gave Tom no choice .
what &apos;ll Tom do tomorrow ?
I &apos;ve always f@@ ed my dogs in the early evening .
in the next four years , 15 billi@@ on eu@@ ro@@ s must be saved .
birds usually wake up early in the morning .
I don &apos;t mind in the sli@@ gh@@ test who he is .
the cold cli@@ mate affe@@ cted his health .
no , thank you . I already ate .
Tom is th@@ row@@ ing st@@ ones at birds .
what am I going to say to Tom ?
what do you want from me ?
is there an A@@ T@@ M close by ?
aren &apos;t you ashamed of yourself ?
you must not eat anything for a few days .
you have to c@@ rea@@ te problems to c@@ rea@@ te pro@@ fit .
it &apos;s good if you can sing .
Tom travel@@ s a lot .
Tom saw a hom@@ eless man s@@ ca@@ ven@@ ging through a ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish bin looking for food .
give peace a chance .
Tom won &apos;t likely feel like doing that .
take that box away !
Tom died from a drug over@@ d@@ ose .
there are many low @-@ cost air@@ lin@@ es in Europe .
was it really that bad ?
I only have 2@@ 4 hours left to decide .
I do all the work .
there was scar@@ c@@ ely any money left .
I &apos;ve never seen Tom so angry .
I don &apos;t know what else Tom told you , but I do know he doesn &apos;t always tell the truth .
who owns the Inter@@ net ?
the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um is one of Ital@@ y &apos;s top t@@ our@@ ist attra@@ c@@ tions .
I wish I &apos;d plan@@ ted more let@@ tu@@ ce this year .
Tom was cour@@ te@@ ous .
on October 20 , Tom died and was re@@ pla@@ ced by an i@@ den@@ tical cl@@ one .
according to Tom , Jane got married last month .

I like this song . it has a nice r@@ hy@@ th@@ m and is dan@@ ce@@ able .
Tom worked very hard .
Tom was in@@ s@@ ane .
we don &apos;t know yet if he really broke his leg . they &apos;ll do an X @-@ ra@@ y of it .
W@@ en@@ j@@ in is a Chinese woman .
Tom and Mary said they weren &apos;t per@@ mit@@ ted to do that anymore .
I got up very early this morning .
she may have been right .
Tom was bi@@ as@@ ed .
please stick this la@@ bel to your ba@@ g@@ ga@@ ge .
Tom walked ahead .
this is for you .
your an@@ ger is completely ju@@ sti@@ fied .
taking mo@@ der@@ ate ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se will do you good .
I have no friends to help me .
it is foo@@ li@@ sh of you to believe such a thing .
how well can you sk@@ ate ?
don &apos;t tell c@@ rude jo@@ kes in the pre@@ sen@@ ce of my father .
my sister ou@@ ted me to my parents !
tell me how to sp@@ ell the word .
I am very con@@ ser@@ va@@ tive .
you could get arrested for that .
I had ren@@ ted it the day before .
though Al@@ f@@ red is sc@@ rup@@ ul@@ ous in ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ing his du@@ ties at work , he is less consci@@ enti@@ ous about his ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tions at home .
we don &apos;t do that as often as we used to .
you must apologize to her , and do it at once .
we fle@@ w across the At@@ lan@@ tic .
his mo@@ bi@@ le has been stolen .
I would like to talk to you the day after tomorrow .

rarely do I listen to the ra@@ dio .
the windo@@ ws were open .
those who spend too much time travel@@ ing become stran@@ gers in their own country .
you can &apos;t get blood out of a st@@ one .
I &apos;ve been mis@@ under@@ stood .

I like the old car more than the new .

now listen to me clos@@ ely .

young people like his books .
I grew up in a small town .

I &apos;m sure that Mary can take care of herself .
where does Tom live ?
someone left you a message .
how many people ?
just a moment .
she received the electricity bill today .
the ex@@ port business isn &apos;t doing well .
shall we stop soon ?
I know Tom is old .
who hel@@ ps her ?
W@@ ra@@ p the d@@ ough in clear film and chi@@ ll for 15 to 30 minutes .
you won &apos;t find anyone who &apos;ll do that for you .
a cat is lying on the so@@ fa .

Bel@@ ie@@ f is the death of intelli@@ gen@@ ce .
life is for living .
I thought Tom was Mary &apos;s father .
even the most beautiful rose will someday wi@@ lt .
he is not coming , either .
Tom finally got his wish .
are you coming to the store with me ?
I am coun@@ ting in German .
you &apos;ve got your whole life ahead of you .
Tom asked me who was responsible for the accident .
I inter@@ pre@@ ted what he said in French into Japanese .
Tom is fa@@ ir@@ ly preten@@ ti@@ ous .
he comes to see me ne@@ arly every day .
Tom is full of life .
do you have a viol@@ in ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk with Mary .
it ra@@ ises a red fla@@ g for bus@@ in@@ ess@@ men .

Tom po@@ ked the fire with a stick .
there was once up@@ on a time a king who had t@@ wel@@ ve daughters .
she s@@ wal@@ lowed her pri@@ de .
you have made him what he is .
this is a story written in easy English .
you ought to find nice shoes here .
it &apos;s not that bad .
it &apos;s clear@@ ing up .
do both Tom and Mary snor@@ e ?
qu@@ ality , not quanti@@ ty .
don &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate to ask .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was im@@ poli@@ te .
Tom laugh@@ ed at the mis@@ under@@ standing .
Tom spent three years in Australia .
I can &apos;t give you these .
we were all tired .
it looks like Tom only wears expensive clothes .
that &apos;s probably the best idea to begin with .
nobody answered my question .
how many p@@ an@@ das are there in this zo@@ o ?
were you in America last month ?
I used to be a drug ad@@ di@@ ct .
if you don &apos;t want to do it , you don &apos;t have to .
do you have any ice ton@@ gs ?
Tom sent Mary a picture of his new kit@@ ten .

I &apos;ll spend Christmas with my family .
your offer is a life @-@ sa@@ ver .
Tom looks a little anno@@ yed .
is that dog m@@ ale or f@@ em@@ ale ?
Mary &apos;s not pretty , but she isn &apos;t ugly , either .
why is everything so compli@@ cated ?
my father is always busy .
S@@ am , don &apos;t !
&quot; Tom knows . &quot; &quot; he does ? did you tell him ? &quot;
I &apos;ll deal with this problem as soon as I can .

my uncle , who lives in Paris , came to see us .
do you read something besi@@ des the Bi@@ ble ?
you &apos;re not planning to stay up all night , are you ?
you are such a crazy dri@@ ver ; you drive me crazy .
the Japanese like to travel in grou@@ ps .
I des@@ pi@@ se my parents .
the prin@@ ce says that the world will be saved by beau@@ ty ! and I ma@@ in@@ tain that the reason he has such pla@@ y@@ ful ideas is that he is in love .
I don &apos;t understand how the human bra@@ in works .
Tom made Mary very happy .
let &apos;s go home , Tom .

do you happen to know how to get down@@ town from here ?
Tom put everything back on the sh@@ elf .
don &apos;t you think I know my own wife ?
I knew he was waiting for Mary .
I am divor@@ ced .
I wish you &apos;d stop doing that .
don &apos;t try to fri@@ gh@@ ten me .
she &apos;s not a good cook .
if I had enough money , I could buy this book .
Tom and Mary went hun@@ ting for E@@ a@@ ster eggs .
I am happy to hear your voice .
the Japanese are gener@@ ally consi@@ dered to be very in@@ du@@ stri@@ ous .
the m@@ ist pre@@ ven@@ ted him from se@@ eing very far .
I &apos;ve done that a few times .
the last time that I sm@@ ell@@ ed something si@@ mi@@ lar to this tea was in the gi@@ ra@@ ffe house at the zo@@ o .
I &apos;ve never been so happy to see pota@@ toes in my life .
is it true that you &apos;ve never played po@@ ker before ?
it &apos;s hard to please him .
I &apos;ve tried everything .
a squ@@ are has four an@@ gl@@ es .
I don &apos;t have time to listen to your life story .
she fell in love with her teacher .
his daughter is a n@@ ur@@ se .
it &apos;s very cold this winter .
why don &apos;t you say anything ?
Tom left the room .
she killed time reading a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine while she waited .
have you ever tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed by plane ?
Tom won@@ dered what Mary was so upset about .
I didn &apos;t want to look foo@@ li@@ sh .
Tom passed the bu@@ tter to Mary .
Tom bought a rose and gave it to Mary .
I can &apos;t tell you the reason why I did that .
you &apos;re really gi@@ f@@ ted .
my mother &apos;s reli@@ gion helped her to come to ter@@ ms with my father &apos;s death .
stop hi@@ tting Tom .
thank you , C@@ ap@@ tain Ob@@ vi@@ ous .
I used to keep a diary when I was at high school .
how many different pie@@ ces are there in Japanese chess ?
I know that doesn &apos;t look good .
should I go to the party ?
Tom brought his dog to school .
is there any problem with fe@@ e@@ ding my dog ice cream ?
a foreign language can &apos;t be ma@@ ster@@ ed in a year or so .
let me give this to you before I forget .
Tom came at an in@@ op@@ por@@ tun@@ e time .
Tom didn &apos;t have a chance .
the sta@@ te@@ ment sounds impro@@ b@@ able .
he lost the watch which he had bought the day before .
my legs are as heavy as lea@@ d .
Tom was sc@@ rea@@ ming .
why would Tom lie about something like that ?
Tom and Mary told John they wanted Alice to teach them how to do that .
I &apos;m waiting for a respon@@ se .
I hope I never meet him again .
what do I owe him ?
this progra@@ m has an in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive us@@ er inter@@ face .
it depends on the situ@@ ation .
wai@@ ter , the check , please .
Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice was awake .
where would you go if you could time travel ?
how long do you intend to spend at the library ?
Tom often goes there .
this can@@ di@@ da@@ te is sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ tly better com@@ pared to his pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
the bird was looking for wor@@ ms .
she preten@@ ded to be a student .
my fav@@ ouri@@ te col@@ our is red .
money can &apos;t buy life .
you &apos;re just jealous .
Tom and Mary told John that they didn &apos;t think Alice was sleep@@ y .
he has good reason to get very angry .
Tom will try .
Tom and Mary were both born in Boston .
she acc@@ e@@ ded to our de@@ man@@ ds .
M@@ ana@@ ge@@ ment tried to ap@@ pe@@ ase la@@ b@@ or by off@@ er@@ ing them a b@@ on@@ us .
I missed the point of the joke .
Tom told me to be kind to others .
by the way , how old are you ?
they walked along the street side by side .
what was I talking about , again ?
Tom is non@@ pl@@ ussed .
you may say that it &apos;s sh@@ it .
everything app@@ ears to be going well .
I &apos;m looking for someone who speaks German .
I &apos;d never do something like that .
I &apos;m not ashamed that I am poor .
Tom has to take medicine every three hours .
a coo@@ kie is under the table .
why &apos;d you do that ?
Mar@@ ie had a cat .
give Tom his ke@@ ys .
the village was silent .
that &apos;s why I told you that you shouldn &apos;t go alone .
I didn &apos;t really like the ste@@ w that Tom made .
not so quickly , children , I &apos;m not so young anymore !
he is not a politi@@ ci@@ an but a la@@ w@@ yer .
I &apos;ll help you as soon as I &apos;ve done that .
we look forward to your ent@@ ries .
he &apos;s un@@ consci@@ ous .
leave me alone .
I don &apos;t understand this word . could you par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase it ?
hi , Sus@@ an . how are you ?
let &apos;s start with you .
I &apos;m too old for this .
Tom only sleep@@ s about five hours a night .
are you sure Tom can do it by himself ?
road traffic inju@@ ries are a maj@@ or public health problem and a lea@@ ding cause of death .
I know you think this is a stupid thing to do , but I plan to do it anyway .
no pas@@ sen@@ gers were inju@@ red .
I &apos;m no longer studying French .
stop car@@ ping !
the m@@ ere thought of a sna@@ ke makes me shi@@ ver .
it &apos;s as clear as c@@ r@@ y@@ sta@@ l .
Tom didn &apos;t even have the de@@ cen@@ cy to ad@@ mit it was his fau@@ lt .
have you meas@@ u@@ red it ?
Tom is a big boy .
you &apos;re Russi@@ an ?
Tom and Mary were busy .
she called you .
what else did you see ?
don &apos;t keep bad company .
there &apos;s no rest for the wi@@ cked .
please don &apos;t touch the ice with b@@ are hands .
you should tell him the truth .
we think that the n@@ ar@@ row road was responsible for the accident .
you &apos;re going to have to pay in adv@@ ance .
we need more tal@@ en@@ ted people .
her parents are older than ours .
I &apos;m worried for you .
Tom lives near us .
having been left alone , the baby started to cry .
Tom should be here after lunch .
almost three thousand people died .
sorry , I didn &apos;t mean to inter@@ ru@@ pt you .
the book is new .
Tom has really taught me many things .
Tom and Mary are the only sur@@ vi@@ vor@@ s .
this is how I did it .
the D@@ iet broke up in con@@ fu@@ sion .
Tom would tre@@ at you with respect .
nobody can fore@@ see what &apos;ll happen .
Tom takes after his father .
I already spoke to Tom .
I can &apos;t see the road sig@@ ns in this fo@@ g .
Tom makes a lot more money than I do .
my opinion is a little different from yours .
Tom is interested in French li@@ ter@@ at@@ ure .
get ready for school .
Tom put his hands on Mary &apos;s sh@@ oul@@ ders .
all the pas@@ sen@@ gers were killed in the c@@ ras@@ h .
what good are those ?
do you prefer cu@@ te guys or guys who have class ?
I told W@@ illi@@ am , but he didn &apos;t believe me .
Tom speaks French , doesn &apos;t he ?
&quot; obje@@ ction , your hon@@ or . &quot; &quot; O@@ ver@@ ru@@ led . &quot;
almost everyone I know can speak French .
can I see you in my office for a minute ?
you &apos;re not C@@ anadi@@ an .
they grew angry .
I &apos;m not sure who they were .
the first i@@ tem on Tom &apos;s list of things to take with him on his trip is his mo@@ bi@@ le phone rech@@ ar@@ ger .
have you decided whether you are going into town by bi@@ ke or by bus ?
were both Tom and Mary born in Australia ?
what col@@ or car did you buy ?
I think that you &apos;re wrong .
could you give us a minute ?
Oh , my God !
he did everything for her .
please bring it back tomorrow .
that &apos;s his spe@@ ci@@ al@@ ty .
Tom ate alone .
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to not have enough to eat .
he didn &apos;t exactly co@@ ver himself in gl@@ ory .
Tom wan@@ dered off .
I &apos;ll prote@@ ct Tom .
this re@@ gu@@ la@@ tion will take effe@@ ct next year .
we bar@@ red the door and locked it .
the little boy grew very fast .
I was bored .
Tom said he didn &apos;t know why Mary had to do that .
rich as he is , he is not happy .
she &apos;s such a s@@ wee@@ th@@ ear@@ t .
your ex@@ plan@@ ation is too ab@@ stra@@ ct for me .
V@@ ir@@ tu@@ es and girls are most beautiful before kno@@ wing that they are beautiful .
he slammed the door right in my face .
we will have a ma@@ th qui@@ z tomorrow .
I have a bicycle .
I don &apos;t feel comfor@@ table here .
Tom doesn &apos;t trust the go@@ vern@@ ment .
this is what he said .
the reason I succe@@ e@@ ded was because I was lucky .
she has a ke@@ en business sense .
she is listening to him .
ob@@ vi@@ ously I agree that you should adv@@ ance in life through your own e@@ ffor@@ ts .
Tom is not welcome in this house .
I have a message for you from her .
before going to France , Mr. Su@@ zu@@ k@@ i stu@@ died French .
after lunch today , our plan is to take a walk in the park .
take ac@@ tion .
Mike takes after his father in everything .
Tom and Mary won@@ dered if John could be per@@ su@@ a@@ ded teach their children French .
the ini@@ ti@@ al sy@@ mp@@ t@@ oms of the di@@ se@@ ase are fe@@ ver and sor@@ e thro@@ at .
a cold rain fell over the city .
when should I pick you up tomorrow ?
So@@ ci@@ al@@ is@@ m never took ro@@ o@@ t in America because the poor see themselves not as an exp@@ lo@@ ited pr@@ ol@@ et@@ ari@@ at , but as tem@@ por@@ ari@@ ly em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sed milli@@ on@@ air@@ es .
she wor@@ e her hair in pla@@ its .
my c@@ ousin is h@@ oo@@ ked on s@@ ma@@ ck .
Tom lives in a row house .
there are a couple of par@@ ks not too far from my house .
what else is there to say ?
he probably won &apos;t come .
she &apos;s afraid of getting sick again .
education is the best anti@@ do@@ te against viol@@ ence .
we have to avo@@ id the nu@@ clear war by all means .
Tom said something to Mary .
you had better not stay up late .
you had pl@@ enty of time .
how much do I owe you for the ticket ?
cook for me .
do you like them ?
please come visit us more often .
Tom and Mary asked me to help them do that .
Mary hasn &apos;t painted her room yet .
the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion is well worth a visit .
why exactly would you want to do that ?
you &apos;ll find the letter under these p@@ ap@@ ers .
today is not so cold .
you should go in there .
men &apos;s natural ri@@ ghts are equ@@ al ; cla@@ im is met by cla@@ im , e@@ ff@@ ort by e@@ ff@@ ort , and force by force .
he &apos;ll fre@@ e@@ ze to death out here .
the fire de@@ stro@@ yed three hou@@ ses .
I don &apos;t want to see her anymore .
I think that Tom is still sleep@@ y .
you &apos;ll have to discuss that with Tom .
the train is coming .
cop@@ y this , please .
I thought that working in a Japanese company would impro@@ ve my Japanese , but it has only ser@@ ved to show me how far I still have to go .
nobody can do that better than Tom .
she wanted to get away from every@@ day life .
I never inten@@ ded to hurt you .
there &apos;s one thing I don &apos;t understand .
she had never seen New York before , so I off@@ ered to show her around .
she looked gla@@ mor@@ ous .
I sat down on the cou@@ ch next to Tom .
few students are interested in reading this no@@ vel .
the trees are beginning to bu@@ d .
my favorite music is po@@ p music .
as he looked through the store window , D@@ im@@ a &apos;s eyes wi@@ den@@ ed as they fell up@@ on a g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous bla@@ ck suit , and then wi@@ den@@ ed even more when he noticed the 3@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ .@@ 99 B@@ Y@@ R price tag .
Li@@ ve@@ st@@ rea@@ ming is popu@@ lar in China .
let &apos;s talk about that over drinks .
being sick is un@@ healthy .
why didn &apos;t the bus stop ?
Tom took a picture .
everybody looks up to him .
Tom divor@@ ced Mary .
she was busy doing her homework .
nobody wants to play with Tom .
would you be kind enough to write ?
I rep@@ lied that I didn &apos;t have parents any more .

don &apos;t look down on the poor .
how much time and en@@ erg@@ y do you spend on pro@@ je@@ cts that don &apos;t make you any money ?
I want to marry Tom .
put me through to the b@@ oss , please .
Tom almost got caught .
Tom had forgotten his umbrella so I l@@ ent him one of mine .
Tom thought about this .
so@@ cial cust@@ oms v@@ ary from country to country .
I &apos;m not sure about that . it depends .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live in Boston for more than a year .
I spent the whole day in the park .
to make a long story short , we married .
she fell asleep on my sh@@ oul@@ der .
look at the flowers in the park .
she was wearing long boo@@ ts .
has something changed ?
Tom and Mary loved each other .
Tom is lucky he has so many friends .
I &apos;m tur@@ ning the light off .
su@@ gar will di@@ ss@@ ol@@ ve in a glass of water quickly .
Tom always speaks in such a low voice that I can bar@@ ely understand what he says .
that &apos;s not what I asked you .
you &apos;ll go to school tomorrow .
my father came home at n@@ ine .
Tom became a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer .
Tom sent me there .
there were no more apples in the box .
there &apos;s a mon@@ ster under my bed .

there &apos;s something I need to show you .
I like the Japanese language very much .
Tom is di@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ing Mary .
he moved out of his parents &apos; place .
have you tried it before ?
what does this have to do with my family ?
he is about for@@ ty .
eigh@@ ty percent of success is sho@@ wing up .
you can &apos;t leave me here alone .
what would I do without you ?
Tom was lon@@ ely .
Tom didn &apos;t understand the question .
there were many who couldn &apos;t recogni@@ ze him in that dis@@ gu@@ ise .
Tom &apos;s c@@ ell@@ phone is rin@@ ging .
I don &apos;t know when Tom will leave Japan .
I don &apos;t think he can hand@@ le the truth .
&quot; why , An@@ ne , how you &apos;ve gro@@ wn ! &quot; she said , almost un@@ belie@@ vin@@ gly .
I got back in my car .
a smar@@ t fal@@ c@@ on hi@@ des its tal@@ ons .

if you plan well , you can spend less time doing un@@ necessary things and get the work done faster .

Mary owns a yellow sports car .
he wants to sell his old car to a man in Ko@@ be .
I &apos;m from C@@ ro@@ a@@ ti@@ a .

tell Tom you can &apos;t do it .
you cannot see your own face without a mi@@ r@@ ror .
Yes , sau@@ sage and sau@@ erk@@ r@@ aut please .

I was fin@@ ed six thousand yen for a par@@ king viol@@ ation .
I &apos;ve been waiting for you all day .
I met an old man who says that he &apos;s never eaten at a restaurant in his whole life .
I would swim through the o@@ cean just to see your smile again .
Tom said I was already un@@ consci@@ ous by the time the par@@ a@@ medic@@ s arrived .
this wri@@ st@@ watch is very v@@ al@@ u@@ able .
that is the thing that conc@@ ern@@ s you .
this TV was made ten years ago and there are no par@@ ts available , so it is impossible to repa@@ ir it .
Tom loves being around people .
the cri@@ min@@ al was ap@@ pre@@ h@@ ended by an off @-@ du@@ ty poli@@ c@@ em@@ an .
I don &apos;t want to write with this pen .

Tom told Mary that he loved Alice .
my m@@ om bought me this to@@ y when I was ei@@ ght years old .
she &apos;s dea@@ f and mu@@ te , and is getting blind , too .
Mary isn &apos;t pretty , but Alice is .
he has a bad re@@ pu@@ tation with his students .
she went on working ti@@ ll he called her .
it &apos;s just between you and me , but Ka@@ zu@@ o &apos;s wife is pre@@ gn@@ ant .
why don &apos;t you wait until Tom gets here ?
we should drink 6@@ 4 o@@ un@@ ces of flu@@ i@@ ds a day .
don &apos;t make me do this .
banan@@ as are en@@ er@@ gi@@ z@@ ing .
I &apos;ve been sick in bed since last Monday .
Tom loves Mary with all his heart .
Tom &apos;s dog atta@@ cked Mary .
it must be the post@@ man .
I met your girlfriend .
I &apos;m so tired that I &apos;m going to bed as soon as I get home .
are you looking for anything in parti@@ cu@@ lar ?
he has three brothers .
Tom heard Mary y@@ elling .
which do you prefer , tea or coffee ?
Tom ex@@ pressed himself clear@@ ly .
I asked for a seat in the no @-@ smoking se@@ ction .
don &apos;t ever talk to me like that again .
after they argu@@ ed , they didn &apos;t speak to each other for a week .
that was only a year ago .
I look forward to reading your report .
it &apos;s v@@ ir@@ tually impossible for Tom to pass the exam .
who else us@@ es it ?
Tom is now mi@@ ddle age and has serious health problems .
who re@@ moved it ?
this is a fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating book .
that &apos;s great ! I &apos;ll look at it later .
Tom still call@@ s French fri@@ es Fre@@ e@@ dom fri@@ es .
Mary is my girlfriend .
the pin@@ k p@@ il@@ low is clean .
Mary will never understand why we want her to do this .
to each his own .
there are fifty star@@ s on the American fla@@ g .
I didn &apos;t know you were coming to visit .
I could make you happy .
you &apos;re bra@@ ver than I am .
I broke that one .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was im@@ poli@@ te .
I don &apos;t want to go outside on a day like this .
